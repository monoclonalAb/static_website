        you are visiting the site of <em>Eric Zheng</em>, an undergraduate
        student studying Mathematics and Computer Science in Auckland, New
        Zealand.
      </p>
      <p>like many of his peers, he:</p>

        <li>dreams about becoming a fabled '10x developer'</li>
        <li>worries about getting replaced by the next Devin</li>
        <li>muses over the Leetcode daily on his journey to class</li>
      </ul>
      <p>outside of university, he:</p>

        <li>

        <h2>fun fact<span>:</span></h2>
        <p>
          when I was 11, I did so happen to write in my yearbook that "I
          want[ed] to be a computer scientist" when I grow up. Apparently
          <b>dreams</b>
          do come true...
          <br />
          <br />
          (correction: I have been reminded that I am yet to graduate, so
          "<b>technically</b>" I am not a computer scientist yet...)
        </p>
      </div>
      <hr />
      <h1>about this site<span>:</span></h1>
      <p>
        now, all antics aside, the website itself was created with pure HTML,
        CSS and Javascript, and was heavily inspired by
        <a href="https://www.ericzheng.org/">Eric Zheng</a>. However, unlike
        other Eric, hosting is done on GitHub purely due to preference.
        Deployment using the GitHub Actions workflow allows me to run the bash
        scripts, generating the site as an artifact which then gets deployed as
        a Github Pages site (meaning I can only store the `./src` files in the
        repository, and do not have to worry about storing duplicate files).
      </p>
      <p>
        coming from a life-long Windows user with limited understanding about
        unix commands, understanding the original workflow did have its
        challenges but development so far has been suprisingly quite smooth.
        (other Eric's bash scripts have been easy enough to follow and my Neovim
        config has a toggle-able autocommand that executes the "static site
        generator" bash file on write). For the purposes of keeping the
        tradition going (no ulterior motives I swear), I have made the executive
        decision to continue to maintain this "static site generator" using pure
        HTML, CSS and Javascript with a few bash scripts.

      <h1>footnote<span>:</span></h1>
      <p>
        to be completely transparent, the creation of this blog/website was
        quite spontaneous, but there were 2 main reasons why I decided to follow
        through:
      </p>
      <ol class="sidebar">
        <li>
          As my career as a full-time undergraduate student is coming to an end,
          I have came to the shocking realisation that I might not ever have as
          great of an opportunity to learn ever again (slightly exaggerated for
          comedic effect). In order to combat this looming stagnation in my
          learning, I thought it would be quite useful to have a custom platform
          to post my writings on topics that interest me (so far, just group
          theory). I hoped that this will then encourage me to deepen my
          knowledge on whatever I so happen to write about (otherwise, I might
          just end up spreading misinformation on the internet).
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          I was also looking to migrate my editor set-up from VS-code to Neovim
          and wanted a project to complete in order to help ease the transition.
          I did hope that upon deployment, I would eventually be able to come up
          with a good excuse for why it was imperative to swap editors, but
          realistically I just thought Neovim looked fun.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p>
      Consequently, as I do hope to remain employed, it is probably an adequate
      time to say that "<i
        >All opinions expressed on this website are my own and do not reflect
        the views or positions of any current or past employers.</i
      >"
