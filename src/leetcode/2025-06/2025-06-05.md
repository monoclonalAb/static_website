This question immediately screams **disjoint set union**.

It basically just requires you to create a separate data structure called a **disjoint set**
(this will be my attempt at explaining the disjoint set class).

In the optimised `DisjointSet` class, there contain 2 arrays:

:::sidebar
- one called `parents`, containing the **parent** values of the disjoint set each value is in
- one called `sizes`, containing the **size** (or number of elements) present in that respective set
    - you could also do by `ranks` (or the height) of the tree representing the set (but they are basically identical)
    - have extremely, extremely, extremely minor performance differences as `size` tends to have **more balanced trees**
        - as a tree can be of **higher rank**, but contain **less nodes**
:::

In this class, there also contain **2 main methods**:

-  **find**

The job of this function is to find the **parent** value of the disjoint set.

In it, however, contains the first optimisation: **path compression**,
where `find` basically shrinks the "path" to the parent using recursion,
meaning future `find` functions will be **near constant time**.

```cpp
int find(int x) {
    return (x == parents[x]) ? x : (parents[x] = find(parents[x]));
}
```

- **merge/union**

The job of this function is to **merge two disjoint sets**

First, we have to check if they are disjoint in the first case. Take `x` and `y` as an example:

```cpp
int xRoot = find(x);
int yRoot = find(y);
if (xRoot == yRoot) return false;
```

If `xRoot` and `yRoot` are both equal,
then we know they are already part of the same set and **do not have to merge anything**.

Else, we have merging to do.

Now, the second optimisation comes in: **union by size**

To ensure, that the "trees" we are creating are more balanced, 
it makes more sense to add the **less dense** "tree" to the **more dense** "tree"
as that will minimise the amount of path compression we will have to do.

```cpp
// swap "xRoot" and "yRoot" if:
if (size[xRoot] < size[yRoot]) {
    swap(xRoot, yRoot);
}
// add to the LARGER root
sizes[xRoot] += sizes[yRoot];
// update the root of the SMALLER root
parents[yRoot] = xRoot;
return true;
```

:::sidebar
- there is a ~~great~~ simple guide on USACO on [disjoint set union](https://usaco.guide/gold/dsu?lang=cpp)
    - it actually does not go into the logic very much
    - this does a better job at explaining the [logic](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-by-rank-and-path-compression-in-union-find-algorithm/)
