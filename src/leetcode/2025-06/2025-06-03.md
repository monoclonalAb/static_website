The hardest part of this problem was actually **understanding what they wanted you to solve**.
Implementation wise, I would rate this as a low-medium.

It is basically just a **breadth-first search** implementation,
where you only add to the `queue` if an un-opened box *becomes openable*.
This only occurs when:

:::sidebar
- you find a `box` but it is **already open**
- you find a `box` but you **already have one or more `keys` for it**
- you find the `key` to a `box` that you already possess
:::

Then, we simply just find the `totalCandy` by summing the candy present in all these opened boxes,
and return it.

## Code<span>:</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCandies(vector<int>& status, vector<int>& candies, vector<vector<int>>& keys, vector<vector<int>>& containedBoxes, vector<int>& initialBoxes) {
        vector<int> boxStatus (status.size(), 0);
        queue<int> openableBoxes;

        for (int& i : initialBoxes) {
            boxStatus[i] = 1;
            if (status[i] == 1) {
                openableBoxes.push(i);
            }
        }

        int totalCandy = 0;
        while(!openableBoxes.empty()) {
            int box = openableBoxes.front();
            openableBoxes.pop();

            totalCandy += candies[box];
            for (int& i : keys[box]) {
                ++status[i];
                if (status[i] == 1 && boxStatus[i] >= 1) {
                    openableBoxes.push(i);
                }
            }

            for (int& i : containedBoxes[box]) {
                ++boxStatus[i];
                if (boxStatus[i] == 1 && status[i] >= 1) {
                    openableBoxes.push(i);
                }
            }
        }

        return totalCandy;
    }
};
```

### Complexity<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- Time: `O(n + k)` where `n` is the number of boxes and `k` is the number of keys present
- Space: `O(n)`
:::

### Time Taken<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- 17 minutes and 32 seconds
    - this question is really straightforward; reading it is a pain up my back-side
