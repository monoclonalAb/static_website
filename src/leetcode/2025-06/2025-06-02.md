The `O(n)` space complexity solution was quite straight-forward to come up with,
taking a **Greedy** approach to solve this problem.

Basically, it hinges on the fact that if we make 2 passes
(one from start to finish and another from finish to start),
if the *previous element's rating* is **smaller** than the *current element's rating*,
we can distribute `1` more candy to the *current element* than the *previous element*.

- the one edge case to consider is, on the **second** iteration, when we are checking if the *previous element's rating* is **smaller** than the *current element's rating*, we also need to check if the *current element* **already receives less candy** when compared to the *previous element* (in that is the case, we **would not have to do anything**)
    - an example: 
        - `ratings:           [1, 3, 6, 2]` 
        - `candy distributed: [1, 2, 3, 1]`
    - in this case, after our first pass from *start* to *finish*, the children at index `2` and `3` already **satisfy** the conditions so we do not have to do anything.

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < ratings.size(); ++i) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]) {
                distributions[i] = distributions[i-1]+1;
            }
        }
        for (int i = ratings.size()-2; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i+1] && distributions[i] <= distributions[i+1]) {
                distributions[i] = distributions[i+1]+1;
            }
            ans += distributions[i+1];
        }
        ans += distributions[0];
        return ans;
    }
};

However, there does exist an `O(1)` solution (which only requires 1 pass).

The intuition for a solution like this is realise that for a `rating` distribution, like the one shown below, it also has the *minimum candy distribution* of:

- `rating:            [1, 3, 6, 9, 3, 2, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2]`
- `candy distributed: [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]`

As you can see from above, there are certain **peaks**. 
Reordering the peaks in a certain order can give us an intuition on how we can solve this problem in **one pass**:

- `rating:            [1| 3, 6, 9| 3, 2| 6, 7| 7| 8, 9| 1, 2]`
- `candy distributed: [1| 2, 3, 4| 1, 2| 2, 3| 1| 2, 3| 1, 2]`

(Maybe the example that I chose does not best represent the algorithm)
Regardless, you might notice that the values in the array go through **3 states**:

:::sidebar
- if a portion of the array is **strictly increasing**, it is simple
    - we just need to make the current person take **1 more** candy than the previous person
- if a portion of the array is **strictly decreasing**, it is more complicated
    - on a high-level we can treat it as a **reverse increasing segment**
        - e.g. for rating `9, 3, 2`, instead of distributing the candy as `3, 2, 1`, we could rearrange it to `1, 2, 3`
    - if the *decreasing segment* is **longer** than the *previous increasing segment*, that implies that the overall "peak" will be higher
        - e.g. for rating `1, 9, 6, 1`, the "peak" has to `3` instead of `2` since the decreasming segment is *longer* and of size `3`
        - we should **track** this `peak` when we are going through a **strictly increasing segment**
        - when our *decreasing segment* is **longer** than the *previous increasing segment*, we should be adding **`1` more candy** every time (as we have to be incrementing our **peak** as well)
- if a portion of the array is **equal**, it **resets the state of the array**
    - this is because neither elements need to follow the restrictions as they are *neither* **larger** nor **smaller** than each other
    - therefore, we can always set the consequent person to require **`1` candy**
