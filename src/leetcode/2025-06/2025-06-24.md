We first initialize an `ans` array to keep track of all our answer indices.

Basically just iterate through the array `nums`,
checking at each index to see if `nums[i] == key`:

- if `true`, then we can reiterate through surrounding elements and add them to the `ans` array.
    - to avoid adding duplicate elements, we keep track of the maximum element added to the `ans` array and ensure that all future elements have a **greater index**
- if `false`, then we just continue.

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == key) {
                for (int j = max(prev, i-k); j < min((int)nums.size(), i+k+1); ++j) {
                    ans.push_back(j);
                }
                prev = i+k+1;
