They be recycling daily questions already??!??!?
(this was the daily question on `21/09/2024`)

This question is just a simple **recursion** problem.
You can see that in the example provided with `n = 13` we get:

- `[1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

as the lexicographical order.

In it, it hints that the recursion equation should be, for any given `i`,
we should have a function that **iterates through all the possible digits in the `one`s column**.
Example:

- for `i = 1`, we have `1` to `9`
- for `i = 130`, we have `130` to `139`
- for `i = 40`, we have `40` to `49`

Then, during this recursive function, while we **iterate through all the possible digits in the `one`s column**.

:::sidebar
- add `i` to the `ans` array
- if `i * 10 <= n`, then that is the next lexicographically smallest integer and, at that moment in time, we should run the recursive function starting at value `i * 10`
    - example, if we have `i = 1` and `10 <= n`, then `10` must be the next lexicographically smallest integer, so we should run the recursive function starting at value `i = 10` etc.

public:
    void addLexicographicalSmallest(vector<int>& ans, int current, int n) {
        for (int i = current; i <= min(current + 9, n); ++i) {
            ans.push_back(i);
            if ((i * 10) <= n) {
                addLexicographicalSmallest(ans, i*10, n);
            }
        }
    }
    vector<int> lexicalOrder(int n) {
        vector<int> ans;
        for (int i = 1; i <= min(9, n); ++i) {
            ans.push_back(i);
            if ((i * 10) <= n) {
                addLexicographicalSmallest(ans, i*10, n);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
