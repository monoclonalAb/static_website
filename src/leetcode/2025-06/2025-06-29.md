For this algorithm, since we need a way to track **minimum** and **maximum** element quickly,
it makes sense to sort `nums` as, we do not care about maintaining the **respective order**.

Consequently, 
if we choose a *viable* **starting** and **ending** element,
that implies that any subsequence containing between the **starting** and **ending** element is viable.
Therefore, for each **starting** element, we should just find the **largest ending element**.

Then, if the **starting** element is at index `l` and the **ending** element is at index `r`,
we have `2^(r-l)` possible subsequences.

That implies that we should also pre-calculate **all** the possible powers of 2 for faster calculations (from repetitions).

        vector<int> pows(nums.size());
        pows[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1 ; i < nums.size(); ++i)
        {
            pows[i] = (pows[i - 1] * 2) % MOD;
        }

        int l = 0, r = nums.size()-1;

            } else {
