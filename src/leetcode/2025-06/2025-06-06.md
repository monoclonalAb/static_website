The logic for this question is quite **straightforward** if you ask the right questions.

Since we can only write a character onto the paper if it is the **last character of string `t`**, 
a question we should ask is:

- for any given character that is present at the end of string `t`, how do we know if we should write it onto the paper?

Now, since we are trying to return the **lexicographically smallest string** that can be written on the paper,
the answer is simply:

- we can write the last letter of `t` onto paper as long as there are no remaining letters in `s` that are **lexicographically smaller than it**

Therefore, 
we should *precalculate* what the **lowest remaining character** is in `s` at each index value
so that we are able to determine whether or not we should write the last letter of `t` onto the paper or not.

Finally, once there are no letters remaining in `s`, we can simply write all the last letters of `t` onto paper, 
giving us the **lexicographically smallest string** that can be written on the paper.

        // stack to keep track of
        // 1.) minimum character in the suffix
        // 2.) last index where this holds true
        stack<pair<char, int>> minSuffixCharacter;
        minSuffixCharacter.push({mn, s.size()-1});
        for (int i = s.size()-2; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (mn-'a' > s[i]-'a') {
                mn = s[i];

            // check if the minimum character changes
            if (minSuffixCharacter.top().second <= i) {
                minSuffixCharacter.pop();
            }
            t.push(s[i]);
            // while the last letter <= minimum character in suffix,
            //  write to the paper
            while (!t.empty() && t.top() <= minSuffixCharacter.top().first) {
                ans += t.top();
                t.pop();
            }

        t.push(s.back());

            ans += t.top();
            t.pop();
