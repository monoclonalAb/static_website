This question is classic **binary search**.

Just realise that depending on the **max difference** we select,
there will be a difference in the choices that we make for the pairs that we choose.

In fact, it is optimal to take a **greedy approach**;
by sorting `nums` from *smallest* to *largest* and checking if the adjacent value is a viable pair or not
given the chosen **max difference** constraint.

- e.g. `1, 5, 5, 7`
    - for a difference of `2`, we will end up choosing `(5, 5)`
    - for a difference of `4`, we will end up choosing `(1, 5)` and `(5, 7)`

Then, the easiest approach we can do to find the minimal **max difference**,
is to use **binary search** to search through all the possible differences
and find the ones that are viable.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int binarySearch(int target, vector<int>&nums, int p) {
        int counter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size()-1; ++i) {
            if (nums[i+1]-nums[i] <= target) {
                ++counter;
                if (counter == p) {
                    return true;
                }
                ++i;
            } 
        }
        return false;
    }
    int minimizeMax(vector<int>& nums, int p) {
        if (p == 0 or nums.size() == 0) return 0;

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            right = max(right, num);
        }

        while (left < right) {
            int middle = left + (right-left)/2;

            if (binarySearch(middle, nums, p)) {
                right = middle;
            } else {
                left = middle+1;
            }
        }
        return right;
    }
};
