When I saw this question, I believed that the intended solution was a **simulation** question.

For one, this is due to the *lenient constraint* of `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
and because there are so many different edge cases in this problem,
that there are not any *obvious improvements* that we can make 
(since we have to iterate through the entirety of `s` in most test-cases anyways).

Therefore, my algorithm hinges on iterating through `s` and keeping track of how many times we have moved in *each direction*.

At each index, we update the direction array, where:

1. `direction[0]` stores `N`
2. `direction[1]` stores `S`
3. `direction[2]` stores `E`
4. `direction[3]` stores `W`

Then, for each pair (there exists 2 pairs; `N` with `S` and `E` with `W`) we need to find the direction that has a **lower frequency**

- for example, if `direction = {9, 5, 2, 6}`, then the directions in each pair with a lower frequency is:
    - `S < N` since `5 <= 9`
    - `E < W` since `2 <= 6`
- and then **sum** both frequencies together -> `minFrequencySum`

Next, we calculate the **maximum** number of letters we can convert:

- we will **either** be able to convert `k` letters or the sum of the letters in directions of each pair with a lower frequency
- e.g. `difference = min(k, minFrequencySum);`

Finally, we see if this answer is the **maximum manhattan distance after `k` changes**

- note, that if we convert `n` letters, we add `2n` to the manhattan distance
- e.g. `ans = max(ans, abs(NCount - SCount) + abs(ECount - WCount) + 2*difference);`

Then, we repeat this process for **every index in the array**.

    int direction[4] = {0};
    void updateDistance(char& d) {
        if (d == 'N') {

        } else if (d == 'S') {
            ++direction[1];
        } else if (d == 'E') {
            ++direction[2];
        } else if (d == 'W') {
            ++direction[3];
        }
    }
public:
    int maxDistance(string s, int k) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            updateDistance(s[i]);

            int minVerticalIndex = 0;
            if (direction[0] > direction [1]) {
                minVerticalIndex = 1;
            }
            int minHorizontalIndex = 2;
            if (direction[2] > direction [3]) {
                minHorizontalIndex = 3;
            }
            
            int difference = min(k, direction[minVerticalIndex] + direction[minHorizontalIndex]);

            ans = max(ans, abs(direction[1]-direction[0]) + abs(direction[3]-direction[2]) + 2*difference);
        }
        return ans;
    }
