Even if we were to use a **hash-map**, 
since we want to iterate through all the keys in order,
that implies that we will still have to sort `nums`.

Therefore, we should just sort `nums` **first**,
and then simply run a **two-pointers solution**, with:

- `l` pointing at `nums[l]`
- `r` pointing at `nums[r]`

Then if `nums[l] + 1 == nums[r]`,
then we can update our `ans` if `r-l+1` is **larger**.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int findLHS(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        int curr = nums[0];
        int l = 0, r = 0, ans = 0;
        while (r < nums.size()-1) 
        {
            if(nums[r+1] > nums[l] + 1)
            {
                if (nums[r] == nums[l]+1) 
                {
                    ans = max(r-l+1, ans);
                }
                while(l <= r && nums[l] != nums[r]) 
                {
                    ++l;
                }
            }
            ++r;
        }
        if (nums[r] == nums[l]+1) 
        {
            ans = max(r-l+1, ans);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
