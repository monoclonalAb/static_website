You can basically view this as a **greedy** problem.

Since we want to maximise the subsequence of `s` that makes up a binary number **smaller or equal to `k`**,
the `1` bits we want to include into the subsequence should be the ones that are **furthest to the right**.

Therefore, our algorithm should iterate from the **end of `s`** to the **start of `s`**.
In the process, you will see either `0` or `1` values:

:::sidebar
- if you see `0`, just add $1$ to the length of the longest subsequence (it has no effect)
- if you see `1`, add the **base-10** counterpart to a running-sum and check if the running-sum is **smaller than or equal to `k`**
    - if it **is**, then you can add $1$ to the length of the longest subsequence
    - else, you can just **continue**

            if (s[i] == '1') {
                if (current + counter <= k) {
                    current += counter;
