This question is like quite straightforward I reckon.

Just iterate through the string `s`, keeping track of each letter's frequency as you iterate through it using a **hashmap**.

Afterwards, just iterate through all the letters and find the:

:::sidebar
- `maxOdd` the *maximum* **odd** count of a letter
- `minEven` the *minimum* **even** count of a letter
:::

Then, simply return `maxOdd - minEven` as the solution.

## Code<span>:</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDifference(string s) {
        int alphabetFrequency[26] = {0};

        for (char c : s) {
            ++alphabetFrequency[c-'a'];
        }

        int minEven = INT32_MAX;
        int maxOdd = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            if (alphabetFrequency[i] != 0) {
                if (alphabetFrequency[i] % 2 == 0) {
                    minEven = min(minEven, alphabetFrequency[i]);
                } else {
                    maxOdd = max(maxOdd, alphabetFrequency[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        return maxOdd - minEven;
    }
};
```

### Complexity<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- Time: `O(n)` where `n` is the size of the string `s`
- Space: `O(1)` since there are always a maximum of `26` letters we have to store the count for
