We can reword this question.

In this question, there are 26 letters with varying frequency: `n_1`, `n_2`, `n_3`, ..., `n_26`

For the **OPTIMAL** solution, we know that we want to set all the *existing letters* to a frequency of `T`.
Intuitively, `T` should be equal to one of `n_1`, `n_2`, `n_3`, ..., `n_26`.

We can demonstrate this with a simple example:

:::important
Let `T = n_1 = 100` and say **none of the `n`s are equal to 99**.
For `T = 100`, say there are `a_1` letters with frequency **greater than `100 + k`** and `a_2` letters with frequency **smaller than `100`**.

- we have to decrement `a_1` letters to `100 + k` frequency
- we have to decrement `a_2` letters to `0` frequency

However, if we were to take `T = 99`,

- we **still have** to decrement `a_1` letters, however, this time it is to `99 + k` frequency
- we **still have** to decrement `a_2` letters to `0` frequency

meaning, overall this takes `a_1` more deletions.
:::

Then, we can iterate through all the letters in `alphabet` with index `i`, `alphabet[i]`, and set it as the `target`.
Now, when we re-iterate through `alphabet` with index `j`, if `i != j`, we have:

:::sidebar
- `alphabet[j] < target`, meaning we have to make `alphabet[j]` number of deletions
- `alphabet[j] > target + k`, meaning we have to make `alphabet[j] - (target + k)` number of deletions 
:::

Then, we simply find the optimal `alphabet[i]` to set as the `target` and simply return the number of deletions made **in total**.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDeletions(string word, int k) {
        int alphabet[26] = {0};
        for (char c : word) {
            ++alphabet[c-'a'];
        }
        int ans = INT32_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            if (alphabet[i] == 0) continue;
            int currAns = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < 26; ++j) {
                if (i == j) continue;
                
                if (alphabet[j] > alphabet[i]+k) {
                    currAns += alphabet[j]-alphabet[i]-k;
                }
                if (alphabet[j] < alphabet[i]) {
                    currAns += alphabet[j];
                }
            }
            ans = min(ans, currAns);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
