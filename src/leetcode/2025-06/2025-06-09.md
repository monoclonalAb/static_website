Lowkey this question is hard...

Obviously, a solution that involves computing **all the integers** in lexicographical order
before finding the `kth` smallest integer will end up TLE-ing.

Now, since having to calculate **each** individual value in lexicographical order is *inefficient*
(as we do not really care about any value other than the `kth` smallest integer),
it would be **stellar** if we were able to skip calculating, for example,
all the values present between `1` and `2` if we can determine that the `kth` smallest integer is not between `1` and `2`.

In actuality, we **can** in *logarithmic time complexity* by computing the number of elements needed to 
**pass to the next consecutive number**.

### Take for example, `n = 110` and `k = 64`.

Obviously at first glance, it is implied that the `64th` smallest integer can not **POSSIBLY** be between `1` and `2`,
but how will our algorithm decipher this?!
a
If we write out the values between `1` and `2` in lexicographical order, we get:

- `1,10,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,11,110,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,2`

Upon further investigation, realise that you can separate the numbers into certain categories:

- all the values between `1` and `2`

    - `1,--,---,---,---,---,---,---,---,---,---,---,--,---,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,2`
    - there is only `2-1 = 1` value here

- all the values between `10` and `20`

    - `1,10,---,---,---,---,---,---,---,---,---,---,11,---,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,2`
    - there is only `20-10 = 10` values here

- all the values between `100` and `200`

    - `1,--,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,--,110,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,2`
    - there is only `111-100 = 11` values here

- so on and so forth...

After grouping and summing the values together,
we calculate that there is `1 + 10 + 11 = 22` numbers needed to pass to go from `1` to `2`.

- therefore, we know the `64th` smallest integer is not present between `1` and `2` and can now check if it is present between `2` and `3`

We can repeat this, until we find out that the `64th` smallest integers is present between `5` and `6`.
Then, since the elements between `5` and `6` are:

- `5,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,6`

We can shrink the "borders" by multiplying `5` by a factor of `10` to check if the `64th` smallest integers
are present between `50` and `51` (and so on and so forth).

This forms the basis of our algorithm.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countElementsBetween(long long current, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        long long next = current + 1;
        while (current <= n) {
            count += min((long long) n+1, next)-current;
            current *= 10;
            next *= 10;
        }
        return count;
    }
    int findKthNumber(int n, int k) {
        long long current = 1;
        --k;

        while (k > 0) {
            int currentDifference = countElementsBetween(current, n);
            if (currentDifference <= k) {
                k -= currentDifference;
                ++current;
            } else {
                --k;
                current *= 10;
            }
        }

        return current;
    }
};
```
