My original set-up was an `O(limit)` solution, where you iterated from `0` to `limit` inclusive.

That would represent the candies one of the children would receive.
We then check for the **largest** amount of candies we can distribute to one of the remaining children. It is the minimum value between:

:::sidebar
- `limit`, as that is the **maximum** amount of candies that a child can receive
- `n - i`, which is the **total** minus the candies the **first child received**
    - this is because we can set the a child to receive `0` candies, so the last one would receive `n-i` candies
:::

Then, after finding the **largest** amount of candies we can distribute to one of the remaining children,
we can hence calculate the **minimum** amount of candies we can distribute to the last child.

As long as the **minimum** that we calculate is *smaller than or equal to* the **maximum**,
we can add the *difference between the two + 1* to find the total number of configurations we can form
(if the first child gets `i` candies).

An example, for `n = 6` and `limit = 6`, if we have `i = 1`, then:

- **minimum difference** = 0
- **maximum difference** = 5

so we can form 6 configurations:

1. `1, 0, 5`
2. `1, 1, 4`
3. `1, 2, 3`
4. `1, 4, 2`
5. `1, 4, 1`
6. `1, 5, 0`

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    long long distributeCandies(int n, int limit) {
        if (limit*3 < n) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            long long ans = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i <= limit; ++i) {
                int difference = min(n-i, limit);
                if (n-i-difference <= difference) {
                    ans += (2*difference+i-n)+1;
                }
            }
            return ans;
        }
    }
};
```

Note, there does exist a math solution to this problem, using the **inclusion and exclusion property**.

Basically, you can use **permutations and combinations** to calculate:

- total number of ways of distributing `n` candies to `3` children (1 possible arrangement)
- total number of ways of distributing `n` candies to `3` children BUT `1` child has `limit+1` candies already (3 possible arrangements)
- total number of ways of distributing `n` candies to `3` children BUT `2` children has `limit+1` candies already (3 possible arrangements)
- total number of ways of distributing `n` candies to `3` children BUT `3` children has `limit+1` candies already (1 possible arrangement)

Since there is overlap between all the sets,
using the **inclusion and exclusion property**, we can effectively calculate the answer in `O(1)` time:

$$
C_(n+2)^2 - 3 \times C_{n-(limit+1)+2}^2 + 3 \times C_{n-2 \times (limit+1)+2}^2 - C_{n-3\times(limit+1)+2}^2
$$
