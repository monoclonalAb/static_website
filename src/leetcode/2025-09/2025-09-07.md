Simply add all integers between `[-n/2, -1]` and `[1, n/2]` into the `ans` array
as they will always sum to `0`.

Then, if `n` is odd, we have to add one more unique integer, `0`, into the array,
which will not affect the sum of the pre-existing integers.
Finally, we can simply just return the `ans` array.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sumZero(int n) {
        vector<int> ans;
        for (int i = -n/2; i <= -1; ++i) {
            ans.push_back(i);
        }
        if (n % 2 == 1) {
            ans.push_back(0);
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= n/2; ++i) {
            ans.push_back(i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
