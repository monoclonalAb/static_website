For this question, realise that a string can have:

:::sidebar
- **zero** vowels
    - **Bob** would always win as Alice cannot make her move 
- an **odd** number of vowels
    - **Alice** can always win as she would erase the entire string, making it impossible for Bob to make a move
- an **even** number of vowels (non-zero)
    - **Alice** can always win
    - if there are `n` vowels in the string
        - since `n` is even, Alice can erase `n-1` vowels to leave `1` vowel
        - then, Bob either loses (no consonants to erase) or erases consonants
        - afterwards, Alice can erase all the leftover letters (including the `1` vowel), meaning Bob will always consequently lose
:::

Therefore, we can just define a function to return if a character is a vowel:

```cpp
bool isVowel(char c) {
    return c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u';
}
```

Finally, we can iterate through the string and return a **Bob** win if and only if there are zero vowels in the string.
Otherwise, we can return an **Alice** win.

```cpp
bool doesAliceWin(string s) {
    int count = 0;
    for (char& c : s) {
        if(isVowel(c)) {
            ++count;
        }
    }

    return count == 0 ? false : true;
}
```

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    bool doesAliceWin(string s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (char& c : s) {
            if(isVowel(c)) {
                ++count;
            }
        }

        return count == 0 ? false : true;
    }
private:
    bool isVowel(char c) {
        return c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u';
    }
};
```
