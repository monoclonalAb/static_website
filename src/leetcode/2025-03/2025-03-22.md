This solution hinges on **Breadth-first Search**. 

Realise that, to verify if a component is connected or not,
we can:

::: sidebar
- count the *number of connected nodes*
- mark all the connected nodes as *visited*
:::

Then, we check all the connected nodes;
for the node to be a part of a ***completed connected component***:

::: sidebar
- all the connected nodes **must be visited**
    - if there is an *unvisited* node, then there must exist an *extra node*
- the number of connected nodes must be the **same** as the number of connected nodes to the parent
    - if there are *less* connected nodes, then it must be *missing an edge*
    - if there are *more* connected nodes, then there must exist an *extra node*
:::

If the nodes is not a part of a *completed connected component*,
we can simply run **DFS** until we search the entire component and mark all its nodes as **seen**.

        bool complete = true;

        seen[current] = 1;
        for (int child : adjacencyMatrix[current]) {
            if (seen[child] == 1) continue;

            complete = false;
            bfs(child, parent_size, adjacencyMatrix, seen);
        }

            seen[i] = 1;

            bool complete = true;
            for (int child : adjacencyMatrix[i]) {
                seen[child] = 1;
            }
            for (int child : adjacencyMatrix[i]) {
                if (!bfs(child, (int)adjacencyMatrix[i].size(), adjacencyMatrix, seen)) {
                    complete = false;
                }
