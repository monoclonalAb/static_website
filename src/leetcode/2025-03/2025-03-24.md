You start off the algorithm by sorting the meetings from *smallest* to *largest*.

Next, we keep track of the maximum `meetings[i][1]` value with `prev`,
as that tells us when the previous meeting *ends*.
Then, when we iterate through `meetings`, we check if `meetings[i][0] > prev + 1`:

::: sidebar
- if the inequality is `true`, then that implies that there are `meetings[i][0] - prev - 1` days where the employee is available for work but no meetings are scheduled
- if the inequality is `false`, then that implies that both meeting times overlap, so for that specific instance, there does not exist any days where the employee is available for work with no meetings scheduled
:::

Finally, we just simply sum up these values into `ans` and return it.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int countDays(int days, vector<vector<int>>& meetings) {
        sort(meetings.begin(), meetings.end());
        meetings.push_back({days+1, days+1});
        int ans = 0;
        int prev = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < meetings.size(); ++i) {
            if (meetings[i][0] - prev - 1 > 0) {
                ans += meetings[i][0] - prev - 1;
            }
            prev = max(prev, meetings[i][1]);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
