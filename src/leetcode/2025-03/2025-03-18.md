I mean, you read "a **subarray** is a **contiguous** part of an subarray" and you should probably be thinking about **sliding windows**.

The key logic to this algorithm is realising that,
given that we have a **nice** subarray of length `n-1`,
to check whether adding a `n`th element would keep the subarray **nice**,
instead of using bitwise `AND` on all possible pairs,
we can instead `XOR` all elements and `AND` it with the `n`th element to check whether the subarray will still be **nice**.

Then, paired with the **sliding window** technique, 
we can basically just keep track of the `XOR` of all elements inside the subarray with a variable like `val`.
That means, whenever we increment the left or right pointer, `l` and `r`, 
to shrink/expand the window, we just need `XOR` the value present at that index to "remove"/"add" it to `val`
for comparing future elements.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int longestNiceSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        int val = 0;
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        for (; l < nums.size() && r < nums.size(); ++l) {
            for(; r < nums.size() && ((val & nums[r]) == 0); ++r) {
                val ^= nums[r];
            }
            ans = max(ans, r-l);
            val ^= nums[l];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
