My first thought was that a **sliding window** might just be the *key* to success!

Unfortunately, I realised that this was not *optimal*,
as the most important statistic to be tracking is the **current length** of *alternating elements*, `alternating_length`,
which can just be tracked with *one* iteration.
This is because, if `alternating_length` is **greater than or equal** to `k`,
we know that the current number of **alternating** groups length `k` is equal to `alternating_length-k+1`.

Knowing this and iterating through `colors.size()+k-1` elements 
(using `modulo` to wrap back to the start),
it means we can calculate the number of **alternating** group in *just one pass*.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfAlternatingGroups(vector<int>& colors, int k) {
        int alternating_length = 1;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < colors.size()+k-1; ++i) {
            int prev_index = (i-1)%colors.size();
            int curr_index = i%colors.size();
            if (colors[prev_index] != colors[curr_index]) {
                ++alternating_length;
            } else {
                if (alternating_length >= k) {
                    ans += alternating_length - k + 1;
                }
                alternating_length = 1;
            }
        }
        if (alternating_length >= k) {
            ans += alternating_length - k + 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
