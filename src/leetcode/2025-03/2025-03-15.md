Quite similar to [yesterday's problem](leetcode/2025-03-14), as you are meant to **binary search** the **capability** of the robber, and to see if it is valid or not.

You basically just:

:::sidebar
- initialize `left` and `right` as the `min_element` and `max_element` inside `nums`
- binary search for the minimum **capability** that satisfies all the question constraints
:::

## Code<span>:</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int minCapability(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int left = *min_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int right = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int ans;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left - (left - right)/2;
            
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
                if (nums[i] <= mid) {
                    ++count;
                    ++i;
                    if (count == k) break;
                }
            }
            if (count == k) {
                ans = mid;
                right = mid-1;
            } else {
                left = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Complexity<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- Time: `O(n log (m))` if `n = nums.size()` and `m = max(nums)`
- Space: `O(1)`
:::

### Learnings<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- just remember to have **binary search** in your arsenal whenever you need to *maximize the minimum* or *minimize the maximum*
