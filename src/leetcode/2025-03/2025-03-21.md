I am trying to cook by **finding all the possible recipes from the given supplies**.

I decided to pursue a **depth-first search** solution.
From a high-level perspective, 
whenever we check the ingredients inside of a recipe,
if we were to stumble upon an *unknown recipe* inside of the ingredients,
it makes sense to *check if the unknown recipe* is **feasible** before moving onto the next ingredient.

That is basically a high-level description of **DFS**;
whenever we see a node, we want to check its children before moving on.

I guess you also need to check for *loops* inside of the graph when running **DFS**;
however, such a problem can be easily nullified with the addition of a `seen` array.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> ans = {};
    // recursive function that checks if this recipe is cookable
    // - calls itself on children that are unseen recipes
    bool cookable(int food_index, vector<int> &seen, vector<vector<string>>& ingredients, vector<string>& recipes, unordered_map<string, int> &current_supplies) {
        if (seen[food_index] == 2) return false;
        else if (seen[food_index] == 1) return true;

        seen[food_index] = 2; 
        for (int i = 0; i < ingredients[food_index].size(); ++i) {
            string ingredient = ingredients[food_index][i];
            int supply_index = current_supplies[ingredient];
            if (supply_index == 0) {
                return false;
            } else if (supply_index > 0) {
                if (seen[supply_index-1] == 2) {
                    return false;
                } else if (seen[supply_index-1] == 0) {
                    if (cookable(supply_index-1, seen, ingredients, recipes, current_supplies)) {
                        seen[supply_index-1] = 1;
                        ans.push_back(recipes[supply_index-1]);

        return true;
    }
    vector<string> findAllRecipes(vector<string>& recipes, vector<vector<string>>& ingredients, vector<string>& supplies) {
        // basically `current_supplies` stores all the supplies and ingredients
        // - if current_supplies[food] == -1, then it is in `supplies`
        // - if current_supplies[food] > 1, then it stores the index of the recipe in `recipes` (the index is `current_supplies[food]-1`)
        // - if current_supplies[food] == 0, then it does not exist
        unordered_map<string, int> current_supplies;
        for (int i = 0; i < recipes.size(); ++i) {
            current_supplies[recipes[i]] = i+1;
        }
        for (string supply : supplies) {
            current_supplies[supply] = -1;
        }
        
        int ans_size = -1;
        // stores `seen` recipes
        // - if `seen[index] == 1`, then it is a valid recipe
        // - if `seen[index] == 2`, then it is an invalid recipe
        vector<int> seen (recipes.size(), 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < recipes.size(); ++i) {
            if (seen[i] != 0) continue;
            // check if this recipe is 'cookable' or not
            if (cookable(i, seen, ingredients, recipes, current_supplies)) {
                seen[i] = 1;
                ans.push_back(recipes[i]);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
