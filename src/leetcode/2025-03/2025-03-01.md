The key to this question is to *track the `prev` element*, 
so we know **when** we have to apply the operation.
Our plan is to sort all the **non-zero** elements first, 
before iterating through the remaining elements in the array and setting them equal to zero.

To do this, we initialise `prev = -1` and `index = 0`, to track where the next element should be placed,
before iterating through the entire array:

- if `nums[i] == 0`, then we can skip this element and set `prev = -1` (so the operation will not be triggered)
- if `nums[i] != 0`, then:
    - if `prev == nums[i]`, we know we **have** to apply the operation, so we multiply the previous `index` by `2`, before setting `prev = -1` (so the operations will not be triggered)
    - if `prev != nums[i]`, we know we **do not** apply the operation, but instead set `nums[index] = nums[i]`, update `prev = nums[i]` and increment `index` by `1`
:::

Now, if `index != nums.size()`, that implies that there still exists `0` elements that have not been shifted to the end yet.
Therefore, we can finish the question by setting all the **remaining** elements to `0`.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> applyOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int index = 0;
        int prev = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] != 0) {
                if (prev != nums[i]) {
                    prev = nums[i];
                    nums[index++] = prev;
                } else if (prev == nums[i]) {
                    nums[index-1] *= 2;
                    prev = -1;
                }
            } else {
                prev = -1;
            }
        }

        for (; index < nums.size(); ++index) {
            nums[index] = 0;
        }
        return nums;
    }
};
