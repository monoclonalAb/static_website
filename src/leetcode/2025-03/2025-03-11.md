This question is just yesterday's question, but **not on steroids**.

This is a **sliding window** solution so there do exist 2 pointers; `l` and `r`.

During every iteration of our algorithm, we want to:

::: sidebar
- extend the `r` side of the **sliding window** until we have a sliding window with `unique_letters == 3`
- then, if `unique_letters == 3` is `true`, we can increment add `s.size()-r+1` to `ans`
    - this is because, we know that extending the window past index `r` will always return a **valid substring**
- finally, we can remove `s[l]` from our counter and increment `l`
    - this is because, we have already calculated the number of **valid substrings** starting from index `l`, so now we can do so for index `l+1` and more
:::

Now, the conditions for the iterations to stop should clearly be when:

:::sidebar
- `r >= s.size()` since then, there are no more letters in `s` to iterate through
- `unique_letters < 3` since then, there are no more possible **valid substrings**
    - this is because, we could theoretically reach `r >= s.size()`, however, since `unique_letters == 3`, it means that there potentially still exists **valid substrings** after incrementing `l`
:::

Finally, all that we have to do afterwards is just return `ans`.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSubstrings(string s) {
        int unique_letters = 0;
        int letter_count[3] = {0};

        int ans = 0;
        for (int l = 0, r = 0; r < s.size() || unique_letters == 3; ++l) {
            for (; r < s.size() && unique_letters < 3; ++r) {
                if (letter_count[s[r]-'a']++ == 0) {
                    ++unique_letters;
                }
            }

            if (unique_letters == 3) ans += s.size()-r+1;

            if (--letter_count[s[l]-'a'] == 0) {
                --unique_letters;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
