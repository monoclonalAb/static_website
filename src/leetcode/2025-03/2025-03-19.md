You can just use a **Greedy Approach** for this question.

Basically, realise that for `nums[0]`, the only way to flip it to `1`, if it was originally equal to `0`,
is if you flip the bits present at `nums[0]`, `nums[1]` and `nums[2]`.
Then, for all operations going forward, we can basically *ignore* `nums[0]` since we know it is already **set to `1`** 
(and there is no reason to do 2 operations on the same index as the 2nd operation reverses the 1st operation).

We can continue this train-of-thought through the entire array, until we reach the last 2 elements.
If these elements are both `1`, then we have **successfully made all elements in `nums` equal to 1**,
and can simply return a count of all the operations made. Otherwise,
it means it is impossible to make all elements in `nums` equal to 1,
and we can **simply return `-1`**.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size()-2; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == 1) continue;
            nums[i+1] ^= 1;
            nums[i+2] ^= 1;
            ++ans;
        }

        for (int i = nums.size()-2; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) return -1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
