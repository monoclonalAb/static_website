I mean, the `O(n)` solution is quite *obvious*; just iterate through `nums` and return the **maximum** number out of the number of **negative** numbers and **positive** numbers. 

The `O(log(n))` solution is also quite *obvious*, 
as you can simply just run 2 **binary search algorithms** to find the index position of the *last* negative number and index position of the *first* positive number.
Then, using simple arithmetic, you can retrieve the number of *negative* and *positive* numbers (as `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order) and simply return the *larger* one.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumCount(vector<int>& nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.size()-1;
        int neg = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left - (left - right)/2;
            if (nums[mid] <= -1) {
                left = mid+1;
            } else {
                right = mid-1;
            }
        }
        neg = left;

        right = nums.size()-1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left - (left - right)/2;
            if (nums[mid] <= 0) {
                left = mid+1;
            } else {
                right = mid-1;
            }
        }

        int pos = left;

        return max(neg, (int)nums.size()-pos);
    }
};
```
