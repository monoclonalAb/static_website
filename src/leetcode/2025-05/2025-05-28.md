This question is quite simple; I was just trying to optimise (disaster) for this question but could not come up with anything feasible.

However, you can simply just reduce this question down to:

```
find the number of elements you can BFS to with a distance of 'k' from each node in 'edges1' and add the MAXIMUM number of elements you can BFS to with a distance of `k-1` from any node in `edges2`
```

:::sidebar
- in `edges2`, after **BFS**-ing from every node with a distance of `k-1`, find the **maximum** possible number of nodes that you can reach when starting on *any node*
    - let this value be `maxGraph2`
- then, create an `ans` vector, setting the value at each node to `maxGraph2`
- finally, we can just run **BFS** from every node with a distance of `k` and add it to `ans[i]`
