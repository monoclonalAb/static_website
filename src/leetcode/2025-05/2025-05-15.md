You can basically just iterate through both `words` and `groups`,
keeping track of the `previous` binary integer.
While you are iterating, if `previous != groups[i]`,
you can just push `words[i]` to the end of `ans` and update `previous`.

# cod<span>e</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> getLongestSubsequence(vector<string>& words, vector<int>& groups) {
        vector<string> ans;
        int previous = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); ++i) 
        {
            if (previous != groups[i]) {
                ans.push_back(words[i]);
                previous = groups[i];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
