## General Algorithm<span>:</span>

I basically realised that there was a pattern for this question. Given a frequency array `letterFrequency`,
with the frequency of `a` being stored at index `0`, `b` at index `1`, `c` at index `2` etc, as an **example**, we have:

```python
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ..., 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]
```

Then after 1 transformation, the frequency array is like a **circular queue** with the value at the last index now appearing at the beginning:
```python
[26, 27, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ..., 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
```
Notice, however that after each transformation, that you always add the value that you shifted to the **immediate next value**
(in this case, it is adding `26` to `1` to get `27`).

After another transformation, you will see something similar occurring:
```python
[25, 51, 27, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ..., 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]
```
(where you add `25` to `26` to get `51`).

Therefore, you can summarise each **transformation** as:

:::sidebar
- taking the **last element** in the *list*, and adding it to the *front*
- adding the **new** *front element* to the *previous front* (now second) *element*
:::

## Further Optimisations<span>:</span>

However, we can further optimise this algorithm by not shifting any elements anymore.
Since we only care about the **character count** in the string **AFTER** transformation,
instead of keeping the *index of each letter constant* and **shifting the frequencys**, 
we could keep the *frequencys in the same location*, and instead **shift the INDEX of each letter**.

An example, using *letters* to represent their respective index positions:
```python
[a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i,  j, ...,  q,  r,  s,  t,  u,  v,  w,  x,  y,  z]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ..., 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]
```

After 1 transformation, **originally** we have:
```python
[a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i,  j, ...,  q,  r,  s,  t,  u,  v,  w,  x,  y,  z]
[26, 27, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ..., 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
```
however, if we **left shift** the index of each letter, we have:
```python
[ b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j,  k, ...,  r,  s,  t,  u,  v,  w,  x,  y,  z,  a]
[27, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ..., 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]
```

After another transformation, we can see the same pattern occurring:
```python
[ a,  b,  c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, ...,  q,  r,  s,  t,  u,  v,  w,  x,  y,  z]
[25, 51, 27, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ..., 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]
```
with **left shifting** the index of each letter, we get:
```python
[ c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, ...,  r,  s,  t,  u,  v,  w,  x,  y,  z,  a,  b]
[27, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ..., 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 51]
```

We can imitate this just by keeping a `pointer` variable that *tracks the index of `z`*.
On every transformation, we make sure `pointer = (26 + pointer - 1) % 26;` gets executed
(*shifts the pointer left on every transformation*, making it **wrap** once it reaches the left most element).

## Code<span>:</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
    static const int MOD = 1e9+7;
public:
    int lengthAfterTransformations(string s, int t) {
        long letterFrequency[26] = {0};
        for (char& c : s) {
            ++letterFrequency[c-'a'];
        }
        int modulus = 25;

        for (int i = 0; i < t; ++i) {
            letterFrequency[(modulus+1)%26] = letterFrequency[(modulus+1)%26] + letterFrequency[modulus] % MOD;
            modulus = (26 + modulus-1) % 26;
        }

        long  sum = 0;
        for (long & frequency : letterFrequency) {
            sum = (sum + frequency) % MOD;
        }
        return (int)sum;
    }
};
```

### Complexity<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- Time: `O(n+t)` where `n` is the size of string `s` and `t` is just the argument `t` 
- Space: `O(1)` since `letterFrequency` will always have 26 indices no matter what length `s` is

### Time Taken<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- 22 minutes and 8 seconds... I was tired...
