Leetcode has become **stale** or what?!

Basically just the last question, 
except now you have to keep track of the time taken to reach the next element as it now *alternates between 1 & 2*.

# cod<span>e</span>

```{.cpp}
class Room {
public:
    int x;
    int y;
    int minTime;
    int move;
    Room(int x, int y, int minTime, int move): x(x), y(y), minTime(minTime), move(move) {};

    bool operator< (const Room& rhs) const {
        return minTime > rhs.minTime;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    int directions[4][2] = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
    int minTimeToReach(vector<vector<int>>& moveTime) {
        int n = moveTime.size(), m = moveTime[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> d(n, vector<int>(m, 0));

        priority_queue<Room, vector<Room>> pq;
        pq.push(Room(0, 0, 0, 1));
        moveTime[0][0] = -1;

        while (!pq.empty()) {
            Room curr = pq.top();
            pq.pop();

            if (curr.x == n - 1 && curr.y == m - 1) break;

            for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
                int new_x = curr.x + directions[i][1];
                int new_y = curr.y + directions[i][0];

                if (new_x >= 0 && new_x < m && new_y >= 0 && new_y < n && moveTime[new_y][new_x] != -1) {
                    int maxTime = max(curr.minTime, moveTime[new_y][new_x]) + curr.move;
                    pq.push(Room(new_x, new_y, maxTime, (curr.move%2)+1));
                    d[new_y][new_x] = maxTime;
                    moveTime[new_y][new_x] = -1;
                }
            }
        }

        return d[n-1][m-1];
    }
};
