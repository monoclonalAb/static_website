You can just store the count of all the pairs in a `9x9` grid
and calculate the number of pairs using the `n * (n-1) / 2` formula,
where `n` denotes the number of equivalent dominoes that exist.

# cod<span>e</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int numEquivDominoPairs(vector<vector<int>>& dominoes) {
        vector<vector<int>> grid (9, vector<int>(9, 0));
        for (auto& domino : dominoes) {
            ++grid[domino[0]-1][domino[1]-1];
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) {
            for (int j = i; j < 9; ++j) {
                int total_pairs = grid[i][j];
                if (i != j) {
                    total_pairs += grid[j][i];
                }
                ans += (total_pairs-1) * (total_pairs) / 2;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

- Time: either `O(n)` where `n` is the size of the array `dominoes` or `O(m^2)` where `m` is the number of pips on each side of the domino
- Space: `O(m^2)`

- who in the flamingo makes dominoes with both sides numbered between 1-9?!

## time take<span>n</span>

:::sidebar
- 7 minutes and 24 seconds
    - I tried to use a `pair<int, int>` as a `key` in an `unordered_map` before realising that it was not feasible oops
    - I could have just made a `vector` of all the pairs and used hashed its index into the `unordered_map` instead
