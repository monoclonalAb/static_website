Basically, realise that there exist **2 cases** for two letter words:

:::sidebar
- a pair of the **same** letters, e.g. `'aa'`
- a pair of **different** letters, e.g. `'ab'`
:::

Now, when we iterate through `words`, we can check:

:::sidebar
- if we have seen the **reverse** of `word` before, we can decrement its count in the hashmap and **add `1` to the counter**
    - then, if they are both made up of the **same** letters, we can **decrement** the `duplicateCount`
- if we have **NOT** seen the **reverse** of `word` before, we can increment its count in the hashmap
    - then, if they are both made up of the **same** letters, we can **increment** the `duplicateCount`
:::

Note, the `duplicateCount` exists to check how many spare pairs of the **same** letters exist 
(since, if there exists an **even** number of these pairs, 
it makes more sense to pair them up, rather than use one as the **center piece**)

For example, if we have 2 copies of `aa` with other letters, it makes sense to have `aaaa` paired up rather than just use one `aa` as the center of the palindrome.

public:
    int longestPalindrome(vector<string>& words) {
        int pair = 0;
        int duplicateCount = 0;
        unordered_map<string, int> mp;
        for (string &word : words) {
            if (mp[word] > 0) {
                pair += 1;
                --mp[word];

                if (word[0] == word[1]) {
                    --duplicateCount;
                }
            } else {
                reverse(word.begin(), word.end());
                ++mp[word];
                if (word[0] == word[1]) {
                    ++duplicateCount;
                }
            }
        }
        return 4*pair + 2*(duplicateCount > 0);
    }
};
```

:::sidebar
- Time: `O(n * m)` where `n` is the size of words and `m` is the size of the largest word inside `words`
- Space: `O(n)`

## time take<span>n</span>

:::sidebar
- 11 minutes and 54 seconds
    - it was not a hard question; just trying to see what way is more efficient
    - theoretically existed another way of using a 26x26 matrix to store each pair of strings
