I swear I have done this problem bef-

Instead of manually decrementing *all the values between each query*,
realise that it is extremely inefficient, especially if we have **multiple queries** that are *stacked* on top of each other
as we will be *repeatedly iterating* over the same values

In our case, the ineffficiency we want to address is having to iterate over the same values **multiple times**.
How should we make it so that we only have to do it **once?**

We can simply do this by initializing another array of the same size as `nums` called `processedQueries`
and only incrementing the **starting index** of the query (`processedQueries[starting_index]++;`) 
and decrementing **one past the ending index** of the query (`processedQueries[ending_index+1]--;`).


This works, because as we iterate through `processedQueries`, we can treat **incrementing the starting index** as *entering* a query;
as for all the values up until `ending_index+1`, they are all part of the same query.
That is why we decrement **one past the ending index**, as all the future indices are not a part of the same query anymore.

This means we can keep track of the **number of queries** we have entered in `O(1)` time
and calculate the **maximum amount the value present at this index can be decremented by**.

Therefore, if we cannot set any value present at any index to `zero` (by tracking the queries it is *present in*),
it means we are unable to transform `nums` into a **zero array** and return `false`.

Else, if we have iterated through the entirety of `nums` with *no issues*, we can simply return `true`.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    bool isZeroArray(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<int> processedQueries (nums.size()+1, 0);

        for (vector<int>& query : queries) {
            ++processedQueries[query[0]];
            --processedQueries[query[1]+1];
        }

        int decrementCounter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            decrementCounter += processedQueries[i];
            if (decrementCounter < nums[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
