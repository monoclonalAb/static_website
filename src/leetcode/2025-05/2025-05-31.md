Basically just a **breadth-first search** question. Note, for the remainder of the question, the squares on the board will be **0-indexed**.

First, we keep a matrix `minSteps` which tracks the **minimum number of dice rolls taken to reach a certain cell**.
It is initialized with all values set to `-1`.

Then, initialize a **queue** with square `0` inside and the bottom left of the board (the start of the board) set to a distance of `0`.

Now, starting with `distance = 1`, for each iteration (in otherwords, at each value of `distance`), we:

:::sidebar
- find the size of the queue, `n`
    - there are `n` `cell`s, that can be reached in the **same number of dice rolls**, that we want to *pop* from the queue
- for each `cell` we pop, we check all the cells from `cell + 1` to `cell + 6` and check if they have been visited already
    - we can check this by checking if its `cell` in `minPlace` is not equal to `-1`
        - **EXCEPTION**: if there is a *snake* or *ladder* starting from that `cell`, we instead check if the **destination** of the *snake* or *ladder* in `minPlace` is not equal to `-1`
    - if the `cell` we checked has **not been visited**, we can set its `minPlace` to `distance` and **push** the `cell` into the **queue**
- finally, increment `distance`
:::

Now, if the `queue` is **empty** or the **last** `cell` on the board has been traversed, 
we can exit the while loop and simply return the **minimum number of dice rolls** taken to reach the **last** `cell` on the board stored inside the matrix `minPlace`.

### Complexity<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- Time: `O(n^2)` where `n` is the size of `boards` (side length of the board)
- Space: `O(n^2)`
:::

### Time Taken<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- 31 minutes and 54 seconds
    - lowkey, maybe the tech is to just stop misreading the question-
