This question a **fake medium** or what?!

You can basically *reduce the original question* to:

:::sidebar
If you change all the `0`s present in both arrays to `1`s and *sum the elements of both arrays*, which array has a **larger sum**?
:::

Then, add on a *follow-up question*:

:::sidebar
Given that you know which array has the **LARGER** sum after changing all the 0s present to 1s, does the array with the **SMALLER** sum have any 0s present in its **INITIAL STATE**?
:::

Finally, after answering this question:

:::sidebar
- if `yes`, then we simply return the maximum of both arrays (with all the `0`s converted to `1`s)
- if `no`, then we can simply return `-1`
:::

This is because, we are allowed to change all the `0`s to **ANY STRICTLY POSITIVE NUMBER**,
meaning the minimum sum we can possibly find has to occur when all `0`s are swapped to `1`s.

Therefore that implies that if the **smaller sum** has no `0`s present, it is simply **impossible** to set both sums to be equal.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    long long minSum(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        long long sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0;
        int count1 = 0, count2 = 0;
        for (int& num : nums1) {
            sum1 += num;
            if (num == 0) ++count1;
        }
        for (int& num : nums2) {
            sum2 += num;
            if (num == 0) ++count2;
        }

        if (sum1 + count1 > sum2 + count2 && count2 == 0) {
            return -1;
        } else if (sum1 + count1 < sum2 + count2 && count1 == 0) {
            return -1;
        }
        return max(sum1 + count1, sum2 + count2);
    }
};
```
