This question is just a **dynamic programming** question.

My first thought is, for any index `i`, if the **longest** *subsequence* that ends at the index `i` is greater than `1`,
then the previous word must be located in `words` at an index value between `[0, i)`.
However, then the problem is, how do you know how many previous words existed in this **specific sequence of words**.

We can do this using an array of size `n` that I called `dp`. 
In it, at each index `i`, we hold the:

:::sidebar
- **maximum** *length of the subsequence*
    - allows us to determine which subsequence we are storing at the index (want the longest one)
- **index** of the *previous element* in the *subsequence*
    - allows us to **backtrack** and reconstruct the subsequence from the *tail end*
:::

Then, at index `i`, we can simply check which of the elements at indices smaller than `i` have a **hamming distance** of `1`.
Now, using the `dp` array, we can determine which subsequence (ending at indices containing values with a **hamming distance** of `1` to `i`) 
we want to append `words[i]` to (the **longest** one) and the index of the previous element.

Finally, we can simply just repeat this until we reach the element and **backtrack** from the *tail-end* of the **longest** *subsequence*.
