## Main Algorithm<span>:</span>

Looking at this question, 
since there is no difference between applying `t` transformations on separate letters of the same type,
it makes intuitive sense to precompute the number of letters you are left after transforming each letter in the alphabet `t` times.

But how would you do this?

You can do this by rephrasing the question problem. For example, given the `nums` array:

$$
nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26],
$$

we can compute a `26 x 26` **matrix** to compute the letters formed after 1 transformation.

In this `26 x 26` **matrix**, each row corresponds to the letters formed after 1 transformation.
For example, given the `nums` array above, if we take the letter `c` located at index position `2jI`, 
since `nums[2] = 3`, it means the `3` letters after `c` will be formed. In the matrix, 
that specific row (row 3) will look like:

$$
matrix[row 3] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
$$

If we do this for all the **26 rows**, then we will end up with a **transformation matrix**, `A`.
This **transformation matrix** basically means that, if we want to find the frequency of any letter,
we can just check the index, we can initialize a vector, `v`, of height `26`, with the value at each index being `1`,

$$
v = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]^T
$$

and then do the operation `A * v` so that each index is thus the **length** of each letter after `1` transformation.

For consequent transformations, we can just continue multiplying `v` by `A`. This leads us to our first (and only) optimisation (there is too many...)

## Square and Multiply Algorithm<span>:</span>

To slightly speed-up the **multiplication process**, realise that we can convert it to `O(log(t))`.

Given `t = 23`, we can convert `t` into *binary* to get `0b10111`.

Since multiplying `v` by `A` *23 times* is just `A^23 * v`
Now, using the binary representation of `23`, we get `A^23` = `A^1 + A^2 + A^4 + A^16`.

Overall, that means instead of doing `... * (A * (A * v))` *23 times* (which is equivalent to `A^23 * v`)
we can just continuously **square** `A`,
and break down the original equation into 
```
A^23 * v = (A^1 * v) + (A^2 * v) + (A^4 * v) + (A^16 * v).
```
