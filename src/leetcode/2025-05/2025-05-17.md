I swear I have solved this problem before...

<!-- Priority #1: ? -->

Anyways, the intuition for this solution is,
as long as we place the `0`'s and `2`'s in the correct position,
the remaining `1`'s will naturally end up in the correct position as well.

<!-- Some say it's machines. Others, data. But... -->

Then, since `0`'s always end up at the *start* of `nums` and `2`'s always end up at the *end* of `nums`,
we can initialize **two pointers** to track where we should be placing `0`s and `1`s: `start` and `end`.

<!-- ...one answer has persisted across generations. -->

Now, all we need to do now is iterate between `0` and `end` inclusively (since all the values **past `end`** are all `2`'s,
there is no need to iterate through them).
During each iteration `i`, 

<!-- Te mea nui o te ao... -->

- while `i < end` and `nums[i] == 2`, we should be swapping the value present at `nums[i]` with `nums[end]` and decrementing `end`
- then, consequently, if `nums[i] == 0`, we should be swapping the value present at `nums[i]` with `nums[start]` and incrementing `start`

Then, our colours will be sorted **in-place**.

## Code<span>:</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int start = 0, end = nums.size()-1;

        for (int i = 0; i <= end; ++i) {
            while (i < end && nums[i] == 2) {
                swap(nums[i], nums[end]);
                --end;
            }

            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                if (i != start) {
                    swap(nums[i], nums[start]);
                }
                ++start;
            }
        }
    }
};
