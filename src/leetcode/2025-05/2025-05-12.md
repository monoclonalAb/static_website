Since the solution space is quite small (only a maximum of `449` possible solutions), 
you can just **brute-force** this with a recursive function.

I basically just iterated through all the possible 3 digit numbers 
(using a **hash-map** to keep track of numbers).
Then, if it is even, I just add it to my `ans` vector.

Finally, since my **recursive** function always iterates from `0` to `9` at each stage,
when we end up pushing digits to the `ans` vector, they will always be **sorted**.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    void recursiveDigits(vector<int>& digits, vector<int>& mp, vector<int>& ans, int curr) {
        if (curr >= 100) {
            if (curr % 2 == 0) ans.push_back(curr);
            return;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
            if (i == 0 && curr == 0) continue;
            if (mp[i] > 0) {
                --mp[i];
                curr = curr * 10 + i;
                recursiveDigits(digits, mp, ans, curr);
                curr /= 10;
                ++mp[i];
            }
        }
    }
    vector<int> findEvenNumbers(vector<int>& digits) {
        vector<int> ans;
        vector<int> mp(10, 0);
        for (int& i : digits) {
            ++mp[i];
        }
        recursiveDigits(digits, mp, ans, 0);
        return ans;
    }
};
```

- Space: `O(1)` (cuz technically, I am only always storing a vector of size `10`)
