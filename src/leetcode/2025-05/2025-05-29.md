Lowkey, this question does not seem toooooo hard.

Basically, for both graphs, we can iterate through all the nodes and colour each one **red** or **blue** 
such that **no two neighbouring nodes** share the same colour.
- then, realise that to find all the nodes that are **target** to a chosen node, we just need to count the number of nodes that share the same colour as it

Knowing this, we just need to:

:::sidebar
- find the count of the **dominant colour** present on `edges2`, `majorityColour2`
- iterate through the nodes in `edges1`; at node `i`, calculate the count of nodes that share the same colour as it and place the values at `ans[i]`
    - add `majorityColour2` to all the elements of `ans`
:::

Finally, we can simply just return `ans`.

        vector<vector<int>> adjacencyArray2 (edges2.size()+1);

        for (vector<int>& edge : edges1) {
            adjacencyArray1[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            adjacencyArray1[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }

            adjacencyArray2[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);

        vector<int> colour1 (edges1.size()+1, 0);

                    }
                }
            }
        }

        majorityColour2 = max(majorityColour2, (int)edges2.size()+1-majorityColour2);

                }
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < edges1.size()+1; ++i) {
            if (colour1[i] == 1) {
                ans[i] += majorityColour1;
            } else {
                ans[i] += (int)edges1.size()+1 - majorityColour1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
