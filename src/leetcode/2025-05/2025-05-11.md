Basically, just iterate through the array `arr`, and keep track of a `count`:

:::sidebar
- if `arr[i]` is **even**, then we can set `count = 0`
- if `arr[i]` is **odd**, then we can increment `count`
::: 

Then, after we check the *parity* of the element, we can simply return `true` if `count == 3`.
Else, after all the iterations, we can simply just return `false` (since we never have 3 consecutive odd numbers).

## Code<span>:</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    bool threeConsecutiveOdds(vector<int>& arr) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int& i : arr) {
            if (i % 2 == 1) {
                ++count;
            } else {
                count = 0;
            }
            if (count == 3) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Complexity<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- Time: `O(n)` where `n` is the size of `arr`
- Space: `O(1)`
