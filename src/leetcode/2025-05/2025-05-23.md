This problem is so cheese-able...

Basically, realise that the entire graph has `n` nodes and is connected with `n-1` edges.
Therefore, since every node is connected (with a distance of `1` to `n-1` edges)
for **any 2 nodes**, realise that if we want to `XOR` **any 2 nodes**, we can just `XOR` **every pair between the 2 nodes**.

To run through an example, let us say the nodes `1` and `4` are connected together with the formation
```
1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4
```

Then, if we wanted to `XOR` both `1` and `4` **ONLY**, we can simply `XOR`:

- `1 -- 2`
- `2 -- 3`
- `3 -- 4`

meaning, since we have `XOR`ed `2` and `3` twice, they cancel out; leaving only nodes `1` and `4` `XOR`ed once.
We could inductively prove that this holds between any 2 nodes that are connected,
but we leave that as an **exercise for the reader**. :P

Therefore, if we simply find all the values where `XOR`ing it with `k` would **INCREASE** the total sum, 
we are effectively able to `XOR` them all **GIVEN** we have an *even* number of target nodes.

If we do not have an *even* number of target nodes, we can either:

:::sidebar
- remove the **smallest positive increase** made after `XOR`ing a node with `k`
- add the **smallest negative decrease** made after `XOR`ing a node with `k`

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumValueSum(vector<int>& nums, int k, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        long long sum = 0;
        bool even = true;
        int minPositiveDiff = INT32_MAX;
        int maxNegativeDiff = INT32_MIN;
        for (int& num : nums) {
            int difference = (num^k)-num;
            if (difference > 0) {
                sum += num^k;
                minPositiveDiff = min(minPositiveDiff, difference);
                even = !even;
            } else {
                maxNegativeDiff = max(maxNegativeDiff, difference);
                sum += num;
            }
        }
        if (!even) {
            return max(sum-minPositiveDiff, sum+maxNegativeDiff);
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
