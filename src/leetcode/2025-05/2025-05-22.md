The intuition for this solution is to iterate through all elements in your array `nums`,
and check **greedily** whether there are enough queries to convert the element to zero.

To be able to determine which queries **might** be useful, we can start by sorting `queries` from smallest to largest. 
Then, when we iterate through `nums`:

:::sidebar
- at iteration `i`, we can also iterate through `queries` and add the **end index** of all the queries, with a **starting index** equal to `i`, to a **max_heap**, `pq`
    - since this algorithm is **greedy**, we are assuming all the previous indices are already **valid**, meaning to maximise value, we should be selecting queries with the **largest coverage** *i.e. the largest end index*
    - we thus add it to a **max_heap** so that we can always track the **maximum end index**
- we also need to keep track of the `currDifference` and make sure `currDifference >= nums[i]`
    - if it is **NOT** true, then we need to keep popping from the **max_heap** and adding to the `currDifference` if the **ending index** is greater than or equal to `i`
- we also maintain a **difference array**, `difference`, to make sure we keep track of when each query ends, and to subtract from `currDifference` once we reach the specified index

public:
    int maxRemoval(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        sort(queries.begin(), queries.end());

        vector<int> difference (nums.size()+1, 0);
        int currentDifference = 0;

        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            currentDifference -= difference[i];
            while (j < queries.size() && i == queries[j][0]) {
                pq.push(queries[j++][1]);
            }
            while (currentDifference < nums[i] && !pq.empty() && pq.top() >= i) {
                ++currentDifference;
                ++difference[pq.top()+1];
                pq.pop();
            }
