Simple **brute-force** all solutions with a **hash-map** solution. 

You can just iterate through all the digits between `1` and `n` and manually iterate through the hash-map to find the number of groups with the **largest** size.

# cod<span>e</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<int, int> mp;
    int countLargestGroup(int n) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            int copy = i;
            int counter = 0;
            while(copy > 0) {
                counter += (copy % 10);
                copy /= 10;
            }
            ++mp[counter];
        }
        int ans = 0, mx = 0;
        for (auto &[key, value] : mp) {
            if (value > mx) {
                ans = 1;
                mx = value;
            } else if (value == mx) {
                ++ans;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

:::sidebar
- when summing up the digits present in an integer, it is quicker to use **division and modulus operations** than rely on conversion from integer to string
:::

## time take<span>n</span>

:::sidebar
- less than 5 minutes?? I should really properly keep track of time
