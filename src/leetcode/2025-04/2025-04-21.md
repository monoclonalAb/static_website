For this question, you just need to realise that the only important information to track is
the **minimum** and **maximum** values, `mn` and `mx`, obtained while summing all the differences in the sequence.

This is because all the possible hidden sequences are just the **same sequences of values**
just shifted a variable number of positions up or down;
the answer is therefore just simply the **number of positions you can shift up or down**
(which you can find by comparing `upper-lower` and `mx-mn`).

## Code<span>:</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfArrays(vector<int>& differences, int lower, int upper) {
        long long mn = 0, mx = 0, current = 0;
        for (int &n : differences) {
            current += n;
            mn = min(mn, current);
            mx = max(mx, current);
        }
        return max((long long) 0, upper-lower-(mx-mn)+1);
    }
};
```
