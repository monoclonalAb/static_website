This question is just an **implementation** question; its quite linear, 
meaning you really just need to follow step-by-step the algorithm that they have described.

In my case, I just defined a **recursive** function that breaks when we have ran the pre-determined number of recursions.
In it, I just simply iterate till I reach a number that is different, 
then append the *number of times* that I have seen that number in a row,
alongside the *value* of the number that I was iterating for.
I repeat this until I reach the end of the string, 
and then return the **resultant string** if enough recursions have occurred.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    string RLE (string curr_sequence, int counter) {
        if (counter == 1){
            return curr_sequence;
        } 
        string next_sequence = "";
        
        int left = 0, right;
        for (; left < curr_sequence.size();) {
            for (right = left; right < curr_sequence.size() && curr_sequence[left] == curr_sequence[right]; ++right);
            next_sequence += to_string(right-left);
            next_sequence += curr_sequence[left];

            left = right;
        }

        return RLE(next_sequence, counter-1);
    }
    string countAndSay(int n) { 
        return RLE("1", n);
    }
};
```
