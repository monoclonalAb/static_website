Basically, just iterate through all the numbers in `nums`, 
convert them to string and check the length of the string and see if it is divisible by 2.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int findNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            string temp = to_string(num);
            if (temp.size() % 2 == 0) {
                ++ans;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
