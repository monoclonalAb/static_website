New **month**, new **me**.

This question talks like a **dynamic programming** question.
Basically, we will keep a `dp` array, 
that intends on tracking the maximum points you can have at a specific index,
while being **fit to solve the current question**.

At each index, we check if `dp[index] = max(dp[index], dp[index-1])`,
since we want to make sure that we start with the **maximum number of points possible**,
and then updating the value present at `min((long long)questions.size(), i+brainpower+1)`
if `dp[index]+points` is larger greater than the value present at that index.

Then, we just keep repeating this for every `question`,
and then simply return the value at the end of `dp`,
as it should be *the* ***maximum*** *points you can earn for the exam*.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    long long mostPoints(vector<vector<int>>& questions) {
        vector<long long> dp (questions.size()+1, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < questions.size(); ++i) {
            long long points = questions[i][0];
            long long brainpower = questions[i][1];
            
            if (i > 0) dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-1]);
            dp[min((long long)questions.size(), i+brainpower+1)] = max(dp[min((long long)questions.size(), i+brainpower+1)], dp[i]+points);
        }
        return max(dp.back(), dp[questions.size()-1]);
    }
};
