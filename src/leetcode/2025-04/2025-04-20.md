After going through some test-cases, it is evident that there is a pattern present;
if we let `answers[i] = n` and let the number of rabbits that return `n` be `count`:
:::sidebar
- if `count % (n+1) != 0`, that implies that there exists a minimum `(n+1) - (count % (n+1))` rabbits that are not present
    - this is because we can group all the rabbits that returned `n` into `count // (n+1)` groups
    - then, that implies that the `count % (n+1)` must be the remainder of a pre-existing group, and there must be `(n+1) - (count % (n+1))` rabbits that are not present
- else, if `count % (n+1) != 0`, that implies that the **minimum** number of rabbits of the same colour are all present

```{.cpp}

public:
    int numRabbits(vector<int>& answers) {
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        for (int n : answers) {
            ++mp[n];
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (auto &[key, value] : mp) {
            if (value % (key+1) != 0) {
                ans += value - (value % (key + 1)) + key+1;
            } else {
                ans += value;
            }

- Time: `O(n+m)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `answers` and `m` is the number of unique elements in `answers`
- Space: `O(m)`
