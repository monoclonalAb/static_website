For this question, you can simplify it to:

:::sidebar
what is the number of pairs that are **smaller than equal to `upper`**
minus the number of pairs that are **smaller than `lower`**.
:::

To accomplish this, we can create a **two-pointers** function that calculates the
**number of pairs that are smaller than equal to `target`**. 

In this function, we have 2 pointers; 
`l` points to the beginning of `nums`, while `r` points to the end of `nums`,
and an `ans` variable to track the .
Now, while `l < r`, 

:::sidebar
- if `nums[l] + nums[r] <= target`, 
    - then we can simply add `r-l` to `ans` 
    - and increment `l` to increase `nums[l] + nums[r]` 
- if `nums[l] + nums[r] > target`,
    - then we can simply decrement `r` to decrease `nums[l] + nums[r]`

## Code<span>:</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    long long lessThanTarget(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        long long l = 0, r = nums.size()-1, ans = 0;
        while (l < r) {
            if (nums[l] + nums[r] <= target) {
                ans += r-l;
                ++l;
            } else {
                --r;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    long long countFairPairs(vector<int>& nums, int lower, int upper) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        return lessThanTarget(nums, upper) - lessThanTarget(nums, lower-1);
    }
};
```

### Complexity<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- Time: `O(n log(n))` where `n` is the size of `nums`
- Space: `O(1)`
:::

### Learnings<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- stop forgetting that to find the values between `l` and `r`, you can simply find the values **smaller than `r`** and subtract from it the number of values **smaller than `l`**
