Initialise an `ans` variable to track the answer - it will be set to `numBottles` initially,
since we are definitely drinking `numBottles` of water.

Then, while `numBottles >= numExchange`, 
it implies that we can still exchange our empty bottles for *new* ones.
This means while the above inequality is **true**, we can simply add `numBottles / numExchange` to our `ans` 
(as these are the *full* bottles of water we are exchanging for)
and then update our existing `numBottles` count with `numBottles / numExchange + numBottles % numExchange`.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int ans = numBottles;
        while (numBottles >= numExchange) {
            ans += numBottles / numExchange;
            numBottles = numBottles / numExchange + numBottles % numExchange;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
