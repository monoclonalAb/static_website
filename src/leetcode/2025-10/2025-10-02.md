It is just a simulation question;
just follow the steps provided in the question directly and you will reach the answer!
(the constraints provided are tiny)

# cod<span>e</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int maxBottlesDrunk(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int ans = numBottles;
        while (++numBottles > numExchange) {
            ++ans;
            numBottles -= numExchange++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

(could technically solve this using math too but like this is waaaaay easier)
