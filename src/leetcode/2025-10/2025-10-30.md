We can take a greedy approach to solving this question;
realise that at the index position `i`, 
we only have to increment a subarray **that starts at index `i`**
if the previous value, `target[i-1]`, was **smaller**. 

# cod<span>e</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int minNumberOperations(vector<int>& target) {
        int ans = 0, prev = 0;
        
        for (int& t : target) {
            if (prev < t) {
                ans += t-prev;
            }
            prev = t;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
