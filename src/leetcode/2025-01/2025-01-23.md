title: "Count-Servers-that-Communicate"

Intuitively speaking, since there is a maximum of `min(m, n)` servers that ***do not** communicate with each other in the `m x n` grid*
and the conditions for this to occur are *so restrictive* (**no** other server in the same row or column),
it should be **easier** to calculate this than the *number of servers that **do** communicate with another server*.
From now on, we will be calling the servers that **do not** communicate with another server, `social-distancing servers`.

The first part of every solution should be the same; *to iterate through the `m x n` grid to gather information*,
meaning our algorithm should have a *minimum time complexity* of `O(m x n)` already.[^1]
To find the number of `social-distancing servers`,
since they have to be the sole server in their respective row and column,
it makes sense to *keep track of `row_count` or `col_count`* (number of servers in each row / column respectively).

I decided to keep track of `col_count` (number of servers in each column) and create a set of all the rows with only 1 element
during my traversal through the `m x n` grid,
as this means that it takes `O(1)` time to determine if a server is `social-distancing` or not,
meaning to determine the number of servers that do not communicate with each other
would only take a time complexity of `O(n)` and a space complexity of `O(m)`,
which was what I perceived to be the *simplest solution that was reasonably optimised*.[^2]

Finally, once you do find the number of `socially-distancing` servers,
just subtract from the total number of servers present to return your answer.

``` {.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int countServers(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        vector<int> col_counter (grid[0].size(), 0);
        unordered_set<int> columns; 

        int ans = 0, m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size(), total_count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            int row_counter = 0, temp_index;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    ++total_count;
                    ++row_counter;
                    ++col_counter[j];
                    temp_index = j;
                }
            }
            if (row_counter == 1) columns.insert(temp_index);
        }
        for (int i : columns) {
            if (col_counter[i] == 1) ++ans;
        }
        return total_count - ans;
    }
}

[^1]: in my opinion, that is quite an insane buffer and gives you quite a lot of creative freedom when trying to find the `socially distancing` servers

[^2]: you could use bitmaps to reduce to `O(1)` if you really wanted to, but it might be slightly over-kill
