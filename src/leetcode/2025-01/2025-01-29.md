My algorithm is quite dependent on **depth-first search** (*again*).

My understanding of the question was that you are *trying to remove an edge from a* **cycle**.
Unfortunately, it **cannot** be *any edge from the cycle*; 
it has to be the one that appears *last in `edges`*.
This means, we have to somehow keep track of **all the nodes** *present in the cycle*.

In reality, this is just a slightly augmented *DFS* algorithm.
The "simple" "top-level" overview is that you just *DFS* until you find a **duplicate node** that is **not** the *parent node*.
Then, you consequently *backtrack* until you reach the **first copy** of the *duplicate node*. 
Afterwards, you continue to backtrack until you reach the *first node*, but you have to **remove every node you visit**.
This will result in you having only *all the elements of the cycle* stored.

Finally, just iterate through `edges` and track the last *index*, where `edges[0]` and `edges[1]` are **both** present in the cycle.
