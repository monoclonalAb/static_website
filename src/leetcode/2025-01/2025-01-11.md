This question is a bit of a troll.

The trick to this question is to realise that the **minimum** number of palindromes is equal to the **number** of letters that have an **odd** count in `s`
and the **maximum** number of palindromes is equal to `s.size()` (since every letter itself *is a palindrome*). 

Therefore, we just need to check that `k` *lies between the *minimimum* and *maximum** count.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    bool canConstruct(string s, int k) {
        vector<int> alphabet (26, 0);
        for (char &c : s) {
            alphabet[c-'a'] ^= 1;
        }
        int odd = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            odd += alphabet[i];
        }
        return (k >= odd) && (k <= s.size());
    }
};
```
