This question is quite straightforward and *does not involve any funny business*.

In my algorithm, I started off by *iterating through the matrix* `mat` and creating a *hashmap* `mp` that 
*maps each integer in the range `[1, m * n]` to their respective positions in the matrix*.
This is possible as each integer present in `arr` and `mat` are **unique**, making a bijective hashmap `mp` possible
(and necessary, as the integer's position in `arr` and `mat` is **random**).

Then, keep an array of integers `counts` and *iterate through `arr`*,
incrementing the count of values painted in each respective row and column,
until the count of values painted in a row or column is **equal** to `n` or `m` respectively.

class Solution {
public:
    int firstCompleteIndex(vector<int>& arr, vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int m = mat.size(), n = mat[0].size();
        unordered_map<int, pair<int, int>> mp;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                mp[mat[i][j]] = {i, j};
            }
        }
        vector<int> counts (m+n, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
            int row = mp[arr[i]].first;
            int col = mp[arr[i]].second;
            ++counts[row];
            ++counts[m+col];
            if (counts[row] == n or counts[m+col] == m) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return 0;
    }
};
```
