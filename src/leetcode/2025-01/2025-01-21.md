**Another straightforward question**! 

The question itself can be simplified down quite a bit;
I understood the problem as given a `2 x n` grid, *find* the `min` of the `max` sum of points present in **any corner** from **any valid position** that *exists after the first robot moves*.
It is quite hard to put into words, so I'll draw a diagram.

Using Example 1:
``` {.md}
+-+-+-+
|2|5|4|
+-+-+-+
|1|5|1|
+-+-+-+
```

Now, since the first robot wants to move from `(0, 0)` to `(1, 2)`, we know it can take **3** paths:

``` {.md}
+-+-+-+    +-+-+-+    +-+-+-+
|0|5|4|    |0|0|4|    |0|0|0|
+-+-+-+ or +-+-+-+ or +-+-+-+
|0|0|0|    |1|0|0|    |1|5|0|
+-+-+-+    +-+-+-+    +-+-+-+
```

Notice that in all these paths, 
the second robot is incentivised to move either through the **bottom left** or **top right** corner as that is where all the *remaining valuable* cells are left.

Therefore, in every state,
you can focus on finding the *`max` sum of points present* in either the *bottom left or top right corner*.
However, since the first robot is playing *optimally* and trying to minimise the points the second robot is receiving,
it means we need to find the `min` of the `max` sum of points.

``` {.md}

          (9)          (4)          (0)
   +-+-+-+      +-+-+-+      +-+-+-+
   |0|5|4|      |0|0|4|      |0|0|0|
   +-+-+-+  or  +-+-+-+  or  +-+-+-+
   |0|0|0|      |1|0|0|      |1|5|0|
   +-+-+-+      +-+-+-+      +-+-+-+
(0)          (1)          (6)

```

Hence, from the diagram above, we can see that the answer is `4`.

# cod<span>e</span>

``` {.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    long long gridGame(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        // bl = bottom left sum, tr = top right sum
        long long bl = 0, tr = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < grid[0].size(); ++i) {
            tr += grid[0][i];
        }
        long long ans = tr;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid[0].size()-1; ++i) {
            bl += grid[1][i];
            tr -= grid[0][i+1];

            /* can afford to break early, 
               since if `ans = max(bl, tr)` is true,
               it means that `ans > bl`,
               and since we are always adding to `bl`, 
               `ans < bl` will never occur again */
            if (ans > max(bl, tr)) {
                ans = max(bl, tr);
            } else break;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
