difficulty: "Easy"

My algorithm starts off by *iterating through the entire string* as it is impossible to generate a score without seeing all the characters
(in my case, for `s.size() = n`, I recorded the score when `left.size() = 1` and `right.size() = n-1`)
Then, to find the maximum, in my case, I just iterated from index position `1` to `n-1` and:

- **added 1** to my score if I saw a `0`
- **subtracted 1** to my score if I saw a `1`

public:
    int maxScore(string s) {
        int mx = 0, n = s.size();
        if (s[0] == '0') ++mx;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (s[i] == '1') ++mx;
        }
        int ans = mx;
        for (int i = 1; i < n-1; ++i) {
            if (s[i] == '0') ++mx;
            else --mx;
            ans = max(ans, mx);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
