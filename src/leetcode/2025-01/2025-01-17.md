The trick to this question is to realise that if,
for example, `[0, 1, 0]` is a valid original array, then consequently, `[1, 0, 1]`, is also a valid original array.

This means that you can set `original[0]` as either `0` or `1`;
the only requirement is that when you reach the last element (let that be at index position `n`),
that \
`derived[n-1] = original[n-1] ⊕ original[0]`.

In my algorithm, I decided to select `original[0] = 0`.
Then, we iterate through the `derived` array, calculating `original[i+1]` at every step with `derived[i] ⊕ original[i]` as we know `derived[i] ⊕ original[i] = (original[i] ⊕ original[i+1]) ⊕ original[i] = original[i+1]`.

Then, once we reach `i = n`, since `original[0] = 0`, we know that `derived[n-1] = original[n-1] ⊕ original[0]`
is equivalent to `derived[n-1] = original[n-1]`, so we just need to prove for equality between the two elements to verify if an `original` array exists.

        for (int i = 0; i < derived.size()-1; ++i) {
            prev ^= derived[i];
        }
        return derived[derived.size()-1] == prev;
    }
};
```
