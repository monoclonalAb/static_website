**i love trivial BFS!!!!**

Just create a queue of all the `water` cells.
Then, for each water level, iterate through the queue of water cells (and simultaneously `pop` them out of the queue), 
whilst traversing to all its **unseen** neighbouring cells, labelling each one `height+1` of the previous cell.
For every **unseen** neighbouring cell that you visit, consequently `push` it to the end of the queue.

Then, just repeat this process until you fill out your `ans` grid maximising heights.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> highestPeak(vector<vector<int>>& isWater) {
        int m = isWater.size(), n = isWater[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> ans (m, vector<int>(n, -1));
        queue <pair<int, int>> cells;
        int counter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (isWater[i][j] == 1) {
                    ans[i][j] = 0;
                    cells.push({i, j});
                }
            }
        }
        int direction[4][2] = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};
        while (!cells.empty()) {
            int size = cells.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                pair<int, int> coordinate = cells.front();
                cells.pop();
                for (int j = 0; j < 4; ++j) {
                    int row = coordinate.first + direction[j][0];
                    int col = coordinate.second + direction[j][1];
    
                    if (row > -1 and row < m and col > -1 and col < n and ans[row][col] == -1) {
                        cells.push({row, col});
                        ans[row][col] = counter+1;
                    }
                }
            }
            ++counter;
