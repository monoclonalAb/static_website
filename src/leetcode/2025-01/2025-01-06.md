**Prefix Sum** might just be the name of the game.

My algorithm stems from the fact that *each `answer[i]` is related to answer[i-1] and answer[i+1]* (if they exist).
What I mean by this, is that, since each `answer[i]` is related towards the *relative position of each ball*
and the relative position of each ball **does not change**, when we iterate through each `answer[i]`, 
we find that we can calculate `answer[i+1]` using our answers from the previous index `answer[i]`.

For example, our `answer[i]` value depends on the `n` balls that we have passed, and the `m` balls that we have not passed yet.
When we calcualte `answer[i+1]`, we find that it is simply just `answer[i] + n - m` 
(as each of the `n` balls gets 1 `box` further, and each of the `m` balls gets 1 `box` closer).

Using this logic, we can just iterate through the `boxes` string to find our answer for `answer[0]`, and use it to calculate the rest of the values inside `answer`.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> minOperations(string boxes) {
        int balls = 0;
        vector<int> ans;
        int curr = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < boxes.size(); ++i) {
            balls += boxes[i]-'0';
            curr += (boxes[i]-'0')*i;
        }
        int passed = 0;
        ans.push_back(curr);
        passed += boxes[0]-'0';
        for (int i = 1; i < boxes.size(); ++i) {
            curr += passed;
            curr -= balls-passed;
            ans.push_back(curr);
            passed += boxes[i]-'0';
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
