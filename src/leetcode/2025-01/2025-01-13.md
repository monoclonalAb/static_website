This question looks a lot more complicated than it actually is.

The trick is that, in string `s`, if a character appears:

::: sidebar
- an **odd** number of times, then we will be able to keep *minimum* **1** character
- an **even** number of times, then we will be able to keep *minimum* **2** characters
:::

(you can easily demonstrate this using an example)

Since there are only **26 letters** in the alphabet, we can keep track of this data in an integer `array` length 26
while we iterate through the string `s`.

# cod<span>e</span>
```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLength(string s) {
        int alphabet[26] = {0};
        for (char c : s) {
            if (alphabet[c-'a'] == 0) {
                ++alphabet[c-'a'];
            } else {
                alphabet[c-'a'] ^= 3;       
            };
        }  
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i : alphabet) {
            ans += i;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
