This question felt slightly confusing, since it always felt like there was a **more optimised solution**.

My algorithm is simply to just:

::: sidebar
- iterate through and find the `first` and `last` index of each letter of the alphabet
- then, for each letter of the alphabet, *if there exists more than 2 elements*, iterate through all the letters between the `first` and `last` index and **track all the unique letters**
:::

Although, this seems quite inefficient, I do not believe there is a way for you to avoid iterating through the same letters 26 times,
as each letter has **unique** `first` and `last` indexes, meaning regardless of however we order it,
we would *still* have to iterate through parts of `s` repeatedly, meaning this **simple** solution might *simply* be better (haha?).

``` {.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int countPalindromicSubsequence(string s) {
        vector<int> start(26, -1);
        vector<int> end(26);

        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (start[s[i]-'a'] == -1) {
                start[s[i]-'a'] = i;
            }
            end[s[i]-'a'] = i;
        }
        
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            vector<int> letters(26);
            int counter = 0;
            if (start[i] < end[i]) {
                for (int j = start[i]+1; j < end[i]; ++j) {
                    if (letters[s[j]-'a'] == 0) {
                        letters[s[j]-'a'] = 1;
                        ++counter;
                        if (counter == 26) {
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            ans += counter;

        return ans;
