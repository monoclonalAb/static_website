This question is currently the **"bane" of my "existence"**.

First thing to note, that the requirement "For every pair of nodes in the graph that are connected by an edge `[a_i, b_i]`, 
if `a_i` belongs to the group with index `x`, and `b_i` belongs to the group with index `y`, 
then `|y - x| = 1`" is only satisfied if there does **not** exist an **odd cycle** in the graph. 
Now, since a graph is **bipartite** if and only it does not have an **odd-length cycle**, we just need to prove that this graph is **bipartite**.

We can do this with **breadth-first search**, as we can alternate between 2 values and allocate 1 to each adjacent node. 
If we see a visited node, we can check if the values match (and alternate properly) before breaking; 
else, we can return `-1` **immediately**.

Now, to find the **maximum** number of groups is just a *boujee* way of saying find the **maximum shortest distance** between **any 2 nodes**.
We can simply do this by running **BFS** through all the nodes in the graph. Simple enough right?

Unfortunately, life is **never** this easy. They mentioned that the given graph may be **disconnected**? 
This basically means, we have to *repeat the previous 2 steps* for **each** disjoint graph and sum up all the **maximum shortest distances**.
This is because the nodes in *separate disjoint graphs* are *never connected* (might just be stating the obvious here),
so we can place each node from *separate disjoint graphs*, into *separate groups* to **maximimise** the number of groups present.

Now, all we need to do is put the above into code. Easy, **right?!?!?!**
