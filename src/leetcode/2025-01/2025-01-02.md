Immediately, when I finished reading the question, I thought of **prefix sums**.

In my algorithm, I iterated through the words in `words` and initalised a **prefix sum array**, `pSum`.
Using `pSum`, I am then able to return `ans` in `O(n)` time, with each `ans[i]` being calculated in `O(1)`.

(if an *array* looked like: `[a, b, c, d]`, \
then its *prefix sum* would look like: `[a, a+b, a+b+c, a+b+c+d]`, \
meaning if we wanted to find the *sum of all elements* between e.g. index `1` and `2` inclusive, \
we can simply do the operation `pSum[2]-pSum[0]` 
to achieve the *same result* **without iterating through the array**)

``` {.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> vowelStrings(vector<string>& words, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<int> pSum (words.size(), 0);
        unordered_set <char> vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};
        int counter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < pSum.size(); ++i) {
            if (vowels.count(words[i][0]) && vowels.count(words[i][words[i].size()-1]))
                ++counter;
            pSum[i] = counter;
        }

        vector<int> ans (queries.size());
        int temp;
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); ++i) {
            temp = pSum[queries[i][1]];
            if (queries[i][0] > 0) {
                temp -= pSum[queries[i][0]-1];
            }
            ans[i] = temp;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
