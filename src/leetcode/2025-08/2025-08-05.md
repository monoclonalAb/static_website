Given the constraints of the problem,
you easily code up a solution where you iterate through `baskets` for each *fruit* inside of `fruits`
and check if there remains any baskets that can fit the *current fruit*.
If this basket exists, then we can just set the current basket to `0` so that it cannot be used by *future fruits*.

# cod<span>e</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int numOfUnplacedFruits(vector<int>& fruits, vector<int>& baskets) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int& fruit : fruits) {
            int stored = false;
            for (int& basket : baskets) {
                if (basket >= fruit) {
                    basket = 0;
                    stored = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!stored) {
                ++ans;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
