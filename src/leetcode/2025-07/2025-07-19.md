difficulty: "Medium"

Originally, my solution was to **sort** `folder` lexicographically and curate a **hashmap** of all the folders.

However, the **hashmap** is actually unnecessary; the last element of the `ans` array is enough.
Since after sorting `folder` lexicographically, 
the parent folders will always end up coming **right before** the sub-folders do.

An example would just be an array consisting of 

```
["/a/b","/a","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
```

after sorting it lexicographically

```
["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
```

meaning the parent folders like `"/a"` and `"/c/d/"` always come right before the sub-folders.
Therefore, since they will also be the **most recently** added string into the `ans` array, 

# cod<span>e</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> removeSubfolders(vector<string>& folder) {
        sort(folder.begin(), folder.end());

        vector<string> ans;
        for (string& s : folder) {
            if (ans.empty() || s.find(ans.back() + '/') != 0) {
                ans.push_back(s);
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
