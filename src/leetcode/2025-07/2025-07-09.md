I realized immediately that this question only cares about the difference between `endTime[i]` and `startTime[i+1]`,
and that the value of `k` just limits the number of `endTime[i]` and `startTime[i+1]` we can concatenate.

To make the rest of the description **easier on my end**, 
I will denote the difference between `endTime[i]` and `startTime[i+1]` as `break[i]`.

Therefore, we can simply run a **sliding window** algorithm,
where we remove the **leftmost `break`** value from our `sum` and add the **next `break`** value to our `sum`.
Initially, I used a `queue` to track this easily, 
however you can do this with `O(1)` space by just doing addition to subtract off the **front** of the `sliding window`.

Some **edge cases** to consider was that the difference between `startTime[0]` and `0` and the difference between `eventTime` and `endTime.back()`.
I accounted for:

1. the **first** by adding `startTime[0]-0` to `sum` initially, and incrementing the *sliding window counter* initially.
2. the **second** by simply `push_back`ing `eventTime` to the end of `startTime`

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFreeTime(int eventTime, int k, vector<int>& startTime, vector<int>& endTime) {
        int i = 0;
        int sum = startTime[0];
        startTime.push_back(eventTime);
        while (i+1 <= k) {
            sum += startTime[i+1] - endTime[i];
            ++i;
        }
        int ans = sum;

        if (i < startTime.size()-1) {
            sum -= startTime[0];
            sum += startTime[i+1]-endTime[i];
            ans = max(ans, sum);
            ++i;
        }

        for (; i < startTime.size()-1; ++i) {
            sum -= startTime[i-k] - endTime[i-k-1];
            sum += startTime[i+1] - endTime[i];
            ans = max(ans, sum);
            }
        return ans;
    }
};
