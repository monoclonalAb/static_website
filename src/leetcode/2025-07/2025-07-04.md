The intuition is, to have constraints as large as `1 <= k <= 10^14`,
there has to be some pattern that exists allowing us to retrieve the `k`th character quickly.

You can see this come up in the example listed below, where you have input:

- `k` = `10`
- `operations` = `[1, 0]`

After 4 operations, we have this:

```
a|b|a|b|b|c|b|c|a|b| a| b| b| c| b| c
0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15
```

where the numbers below denote the letters respective **index**.

While looking at the *letters* and their *respective index*, a pattern begins to reveal itself.
Take index `11` as an example:

- index `11` came from index `3` after operation `0`

```
a|b|a|*b*|b|c|b|c -> a|b| a|* b*| b| c| b| c
0|1|2|*3*|4|5|6|7 -> 8|9|10|*11*|12|13|14|15
```

- index `3` came from index `1` after operation `0`

```
a|*b* -> a|*b*
0|*1* -> 2|*3*
```

- index `1` came from index `0` after operation `1`

```
*a* -> *b* 
*0* -> *1* 
```

If we write `11` into binary, `0b1011`, and relate the position of each `1` to an operation, for example:

- `0b1011 & 0b0001 = 0b0001` so the `11th` digit gets `operation[0 % 2] = 1`
- `0b1011 & 0b0010 = 0b0010` so the `11th` digit gets `operation[1 % 2] = 0`
- `0b1011 & 0b0100 = 0b0100` so the `11th` digit **does not** get `operation[2 % 2] = 1`
- `0b1011 & 0b1000 = 0b1000` so the `11th` digit gets `operation[3 % 2] = 0`

which mirrors the operations **and the order of the operations** the `kth` digit was placed through.

### TLDR<span>:</span>

After `n` operations, `word` will be of length `2^n`. We know that the:

- first `2^(n-1)` characters was not affected by the `nth` operation
- last `2^(n-1)` characters was the result of the `nth` operation on the first `2^(n-1)` characters

Given their respective indices:

- the first `2^(n-1)` characters will have the `nth` bit set to `0`
- the last `2^(n-1)` characters will have the `nth` bit set to `1`

Using an inductive proof, we can show that the `nth` bit being set to `1` 
means that the respective operation has been done on the `kth` character.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    char kthCharacter(long long k, vector<int>& operations) {
        char ans = 'a';
        int index = 0;
        k -= 1;
        while (k > 0) {
            if (k % 2 == 1 && operations[index] == 1) {
                if (ans-'a' == 25) {
                    ans = 'a';
                } else {
                    ans = ans+1;
                }
            }
            index = (index + 1) % operations.size();
            k >>= 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
