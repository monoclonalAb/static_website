You can simply reword the question. Realise that to have a subsequence where adjacent elements sum:

- to an **even value**, it implies that they are all of the **same parity**
- to an **odd value**, it implies that they are of **alternating parity** 

Simply just iterate through `nums` and keep track of **three** things:

:::sidebar
- the count of **odd** numbers
- the count of **even** numbers
- the length of numbers of **alternating parity** present in `nums`, starting from index `0`
:::

Finally, simply return the **maximum** value out of them three.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int parityCount[2] = {0};
        int alternatingLength = 1;
        int alternatingParity = nums[0]%2;
        ++parityCount[nums[0]%2];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            ++parityCount[nums[i]%2];
            if (nums[i]%2 != alternatingParity) {
                alternatingParity = nums[i]%2;
                ++alternatingLength;
            }
        }
        return max(alternatingLength, max(parityCount));
    }
};
```
