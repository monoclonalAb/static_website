Basically just run a **sliding window** and check if the current letter has been repeated more than 3 times.

# cod<span>e</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    string makeFancyString(string s) {
        string ans{};
        char prev{};
        int curCounter{1};
        for (char& c : s) {
            if (c == prev && curCounter < 2) {
                ans += c;
                ++curCounter;
            } else if (c != prev) {
                ans += c;
                prev = c;
                curCounter = 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
