I did this problem too late into the night-

Initially, I thought you could solve this problem by **sorting the events**
(by *end time*, using *start time* as a tiebreaker) and greedily attending events in that order.
However, that runs into the edge case with `[[2,3], [2, 3], [1,4], [1, 4]]`,
where you end up:

- attending event `[2, 3]` at time `2`
- attending event `[2, 3]` at time `3`
- attending event `[1, 4]` at time `4`
- missing event `[1, 4]`, however, you could have attended this event **at time `1`**

However, I still believed a **greedy** approach was optimal.
Therefore, I realised you could take a **greedy** approach at every time stamp;
at each timestamp, you would attend the valid event with the **earliest end time**.

We can make this a reality using a **min heap**, simply adding end times when we *pass the start time*
and removing end times when we *pass them*.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxEvents(vector<vector<int>>& events) {
        sort(events.begin(), events.end());

        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; j < events.size() || !pq.empty(); ++i) {
            while (j < events.size() && events[j][0] <= i) {
                pq.push(events[j++][1]);
            }
            while (!pq.empty() && pq.top() < i) {
                pq.pop();
            }
            if (!pq.empty()) {
                pq.pop();
                ++ans;
            }
        }
        return ansh
    }
};
