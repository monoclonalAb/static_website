This problem is basically [yesterday's problem](https://ericzheng.nz/leetcode/2025-07-09.html)
except you can: 

- reschedule **maximum only 1 meeting**
- relative orderings of meetings **can change**.

This basically means we are concatenating adjacent `break` values 
(where `break[i]` is the positive time difference between `endTime[i]` and `startTime[i+1]`) and trying to find the **maximum possible sum**.

However, what sets this apart from yesterday's question, is that we have to check if there exists another `break` value 
(outside of the 2 that *we are concatenating*)
**GREATER** than our *current meeting* (which is simply the positive time difference between `startTime[i]` and `endTime[i]`)
which we can move our *current meeting* to. 

For example, let the `~` denote a meeting. 

```md
 | ~ |   |   |*~*|   |   |   | ~ |   | ~ |
 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10|
```

In our case, to find the *maximum contiguous period of free time*,
we can simply shift the meeting from *`3` to `4`* to *`8` to `9`* as it is a `break` value that is **not** the 2 that we are concatenating,
giving us a *max free time* of `6`.

```md
 | ~ |   |   |   |   |   |   | ~ |*~*| ~ |
 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10|
```

The easiest way we can check this, is for **every** meeting, we find the **maximum `break` value** to the *left* and to the *right* of the current meeting
(using some sort of **prefix sum array**), and see if there exists a `break` value that can **house our current meeting**. Then, we have 2 cases:

- if it **can**, then we can concatenate adjacent `break` values and **add the current meeting duration** to the sum
    - this is because, we are effectively moving the *meeting* into [Narnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia); never to be seen ever again
- if it **cannot**, then we **only** concatenate adjacent `break` values

Finally, we just keep track of the **max value** and return it.

**However**, this solution is in `O(n)` space complexity, but it is possible to implement it in `O(1)` instead.

Effectively, what my algorithm is doing is iterating **both** from *left to right* and *right to left*.
While it is iterating

:::sidebar
- from *left to right*, it calculates the **maximum `break` value** on the *left* at each index.
- from *right to left*, it calculates the **maximum `break` value** on the *right* at each index.
:::

This means that at every index, **eventually**, 
an `if` statement will run checking whether there is a `break` value large enough to fit itself on both the *left* and *right* side of the current meeting interval.
In the code example below, I have

::: sidebar
- variable `i` that iterates from `0` to `n-1` 
- variable `j` that iterates from `n-1` to `0`
:::

and also annoted the sections which contain the logic checking if there exists an interval **largen enough to house the current meeting time**.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFreeTime(int eventTime, vector<int>& startTime, vector<int>& endTime) {
        int n = startTime.size();
        int ans = 0;
        int maxLHSInterval = 0;
        int maxRHSInterval = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // from left to right
            int LHSLeftIndex = (i == 0) ? 0 : endTime[i-1];
            int LHSRightIndex = (i == n-1) ? eventTime : startTime[i+1];

            int LHSCurrentInterval = endTime[i] - startTime[i];

            // at index `i`, it checks if there exists an interval LARGE ENOUGH to house itself on the LEFT
            if (maxLHSInterval >= LHSCurrentInterval) {
                ans = max(ans, LHSRightIndex - LHSLeftIndex);
            }
            
            maxLHSInterval = max(maxLHSInterval, startTime[i] - ((i == 0) ? 0 : endTime[i-1]));
            ans = max(ans, LHSRightIndex - LHSLeftIndex - LHSCurrentInterval);

            // from right to left
            int j = n-i-1;
            int RHSLeftIndex = (j == 0) ? 0 : endTime[j-1];
            int RHSRightIndex = (j == n-1) ? eventTime : startTime[j+1];

            int RHSCurrentInterval = endTime[j] - startTime[j];

            // at index `j`, it checks if there exists an interval LARGE ENOUGH to house itself on the RIGHT
            if (maxRHSInterval >= RHSCurrentInterval) {
                ans = max(ans, RHSRightIndex - RHSLeftIndex);
            }
            maxRHSInterval = max(maxRHSInterval, ((j == n-1) ? eventTime : startTime[j+1]) - endTime[j]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
