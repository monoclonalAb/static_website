I think this question is rather straightforward.

Since we need to allocate meetings to rooms,
we need to track which rooms are **viable** at the *meeting start time*.
However, sometimes there are *not* any rooms available at the meeting start time,
meaning we also need to track what room frees up next.

To do this, we have **two** minimum heaps:

- one to track the `viableRooms`
    - this contains all the viable room numbers as `integers`
- another to track the `takenRooms`
    - sorts from when the room **frees up** and the room numbers stored inside of `pair<long long, int>` respectively
    - note, `long long` is used since it is possible to have **integer overflow** if all meetings are scheduled into one room

Then, we can just iterate through all the meetings. 

For each meeting, first we check if there are any `takenRooms` that free up before the meeting start time,
and can add them back into the pool of `viableRooms`.
However, if there are **not** any `viableRooms` that exist,
then we just take the `takenRoom` that frees up the **earliest** and use that as the meeting start time instead.

Finally, we just simply take the element of `viableRooms` with the smallest index,
add the meeting duration to the respective meeting start time and add it into the `takenRooms` priority queue.
We make sure to also increment the `freq` of the respective room that we scheduled a meeting in,
before repeating it for **all** the meetings.

Now, we can simply just iterate through all the rooms and return the **lowest** index meeting room that held the **most meetings**.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int mostBooked(int n, vector<vector<int>>& meetings) {
        sort(meetings.begin(), meetings.end());

        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> viableRooms;
        priority_queue<pair<long long, int>, vector<pair<long long, int>>, greater<pair<long long, int>>> takenRooms;

        vector<int> freq(n, 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            viableRooms.push(i);
        }

        for (vector<int>& meeting : meetings) {
            long long meetingStartTime = meeting[0];
            while(!takenRooms.empty()) {
                if (takenRooms.top().first <= meetingStartTime) {
                    viableRooms.push(takenRooms.top().second);
                    takenRooms.pop();
                } else if (viableRooms.empty()) {
                    meetingStartTime = takenRooms.top().first;
                    viableRooms.push(takenRooms.top().second);
                    takenRooms.pop();
                    break;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }

            int roomNumber = viableRooms.top();
            viableRooms.pop();

            takenRooms.emplace(meetingStartTime + meeting[1] - meeting[0], roomNumber);
            ++freq[roomNumber];
        }

        int ansIndex = 0;
        int maxFreq = freq[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < freq.size(); ++i) {
            if (freq[i] > maxFreq) {
                maxFreq = freq[i];
                ansIndex = i;
            }
        }
        return ansIndex;
    }

## learning<span>s</span>

:::sidebar
- apparently the `sort` implementation inside STL for `c++` uses `introsort` which consists of 3 sorting algorithms:
    - quicksort (default)
    - heapsort (if it exceeds the maximum depth limit, to try avoid quicksort's worst case scenario of `O(n^2)`)
    - insertion sort (optimal for small arrays and partially sorted ones)
- time complexity: Best, Average and worst of `O(n log(n))`
- space complexity: uses `O(log(n))` auxiliary stack space
