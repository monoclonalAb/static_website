Just sort the array first and iterate through the entirety of `arr` from **back** to **front**, 
then simply returning the first number you see where its *count* is equal to *itself*
(since the array is sorted from **smallest** to **largest**).

If there does not exist any number where this occurs, just return `-1`.

## Code<span>:</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int findLucky(vector<int>& arr) {
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

        int count = 1;
        int curr = arr.back();
        for (int i = arr.size()-2; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (curr == arr[i]) {
                ++count;
            } else {
                if (count == curr) {
                    return curr;
                }
                curr = arr[i];
                count = 1;
            }
        }
        if (count == curr) {
            return curr;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
