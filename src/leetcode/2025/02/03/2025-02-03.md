title: "Longest-Strictly-Increasing-or-Strictly-Decreasing-Subarray"
question_id: "3105"
question_link: "https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-strictly-increasing-or-strictly-decreasing-subarray/"
difficulty: "Easy"
---

Simply just *iterate* through the array `nums`, keeping track of both `ans` and `counter` variables, 
which tracks the *longest *previous* strictly monotonic subarray* and the *length of the *current* strictly monotonic subarray*.
When iterating through `nums`, keep track of the current `direction` (increasing, decreasing or equal), 
check the relationship of `nums[i-1]` with `nums[i]` and respond accordingly 
(e.g. if `nums[i]` was *strictly increasing* and then suddenly becomes *strictly decreasing*, 
then make `ans = max(ans, counter)`, reset the `counter` variable, and change the `direction` variable)

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int longestMonotonicSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans = 1;
        int counter = 1;
        int direction = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i-1] != nums[i]) {
                if (direction == ((nums[i-1] < nums[i]) ? 1 : -1)) {
                    ++counter;
                } else {
                    direction = (nums[i-1] < nums[i]) ? 1 : -1;
                    ans = max(ans, counter);
                    counter = 2;
                }
            } else {
                direction = 0;
                ans = max(ans, counter);
                counter = 0;
            }
        }
        ans = max(ans, counter);
        return ans;
    }
