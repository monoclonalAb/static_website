It is quite straight-forward to come-up with the `O(n)` solution for this question; on every `add` operation, 
just multiple every **existing** value in the vector by `num` so that our `getProduct` operation is `O(1)`.

My intuition told me that the **constant** time solution depended on a **prefix product array**, `products`.
An example we can look over would be `3 0 2 5 4 8`. 
First, let us define that the value at index position `i` is just `getProduct(getProducts.size()-i)`, 
e.g. on row 6, `32` is `getProduct(6-4) = getProduct(2)` as the product of the last `2` numbers is `8 * 4 = 32`.

Then, at each step, we can list out all the possible `getProduct` return values:

::: sidebar
1. `3`
2. `0, 0`
3. `0, 0, 2`
4. `0, 0, 10, 5`
5. `0, 0, 40, 20, 4`
6. `0, 0, 320, 160, 32, 8`
:::

From this example, we can deduce that:

::: sidebar
- `products` has to be **cleared** and reinitialized every time we iterate over a `0`. 
    - This is because it would make consequent values in `products` equal to `0` as well, meaning there is no reason to store these value before as they will **all** be equal to `0`.
- whenever we initialize `products`, it has to be created with `products.size() == 1` and `products[0] = 1`. Then,
    - for `k < products.size()`, we have to return `products.back() / products[products.size() - k - 1]`. We can easily see this with an example, take row 6: `0 0 320 160 32 8`, where the `products` array should equal `1, 2, 10, 40, 320`, then e.g. `getProduct(3) = 320 / 2 = 160`
    - for `k >= products.size()`, it implies that we have previously encountered a `0` and had to **clear** the `products` array, meaning we should return `0`.
