Because of the *light constraints*, I realised you can just **recurse** over all the possible partitions.

To do this:

::: sidebar
- I iterated through all the integers from `1` to `n` (as any of these values can be **valid**). 
    - Let this integer be `i`.
- taking the square of `i`, notice that between any 2 numbers, we can either choose to **partition** or **not to partition** the square of `i` at this point. 
    - if we keep a running sum of all the possible partitions, eventually we will **exhaust** all possible sums and partitions of the square of `i` 
    - then, we can compare the `currrent_sum` with the `target_sum` to find out if they **match**
- then, just keep another running sum, `ans`, of all the `square` values that make up the **punishment number**

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int checkForSum(int current_sum, int target_sum, int sqbare) {
        int power = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        while (square > 0) {
            current_sum += (square%10)*pow(10, power);
            square /= 10;
            if (current_sum == target_sum && square == 0) {
                return 1;
            } else if (current_sum <= target_sum) {
                ans |= checkForSum(current_sum, target_sum, square);
            }
            ++power;
        }
        return ans;
    }
    int punishmentNumber(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            int square = i*i;
            if (checkForSum(0, i, square) == 1) {
                ans += square;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

### Complexity<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- Time: `O(n * 2^(log_10 n))`
- Space: `O(log_10 n)`
:::

### EEE (Eric's Enlightening Experiences)<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- changing from `int` to `string` can be quite *time consuming*; consider just manipulating the integer directly.

### TTT (Time Taken Today)<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- it was like ~18 minutes
    - took me too long to realise you were just meant to **brute-force** all cases
