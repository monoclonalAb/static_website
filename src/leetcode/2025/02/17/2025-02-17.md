This week seems to be the week of the **backtracking**.

A simple **recursion** algorithm would suffice; just create an array of size `26` to hold the *count* of each letter of the alphabet,
and iterate through all possibilities at each index.

## Code<span>:</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int recursion(int index, int length, int *a) {
        if (index == length) return 0;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            if (a[i] == 0) continue;
            --a[i];
            ++ans;
            ans += recursion(1, length, a);
            ++a[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
    int numTilePossibilities(string tiles) {
        int a[26] = {0};
        for (char c : tiles) ++a[c-'A'];
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            if (a[i] == 0) continue;
            --a[i];
            ++ans;
            ans += recursion(1, tiles.size(), a);
            ++a[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Complexity<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- Time: `O(2^n)`
- Space: `O(n)`
:::

### EEE (Eric's Enlightening Experiences)<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- if you want to pass an integer array as an argument into a function, it's type is just `int *a` since that just points to the first index in the array.

### TTT (Time Taken Today)<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- 13 minutes and 8.04 seconds
    - realistically took me ~6 minutes but I forgot how typing works
