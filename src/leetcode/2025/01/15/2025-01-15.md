This question is also a lot simpler than what it first appears.

Logically, it makes sense that you start to find `x` by making `x = num1` and then *continue to add/substract bits*.
If we denote `bits1` and `bits2` as the number of **set** bits in `num1` and `num2` respectively,
then we have **3 potential outcomes**:

::: sidebar
1. if `bits1 < bits2`, then we need to **add** set bits to `x`. Since we want `x` to be closest to `nums1`, we should start adding bits from the **least significant bit** to minimise the difference.
2. if `bits1 = bits2`, then just return `x` as `bits1`
3. if `bits1 > bits2`, then we need to **remove** set bits from `x`. Since we want `x` to be closest to `nums1`, we should start removing bits from the **least significant bit** to minimise the difference.

Then, we just *remove / add bits* until the number of set bits in `x` is **equal** to the bits in `num1s`.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int minimizeXor(int num1, int num2) {
        int bits1 = __builtin_popcount(num1), bits2 = __builtin_popcount(num2);
        int ans = num1;
        int index = 0;
        while(bits1 != bits2) {
            if (bits1 < bits2 && (1 << index & ans) == 0) {
                ans ^= 1 << index;
                ++bits1;
            } else if (bits1 > bits2 && (1 << index & ans) > 0) {
                ans ^= 1 << index;
                --bits1;
            }
            ++index;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
