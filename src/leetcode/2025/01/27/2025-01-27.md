(I really wanted to make a `bitset` solution work)

My solution to this questions involves **depth-first search**.

First, I wanted to record all the edges in an **adjacency matrix** so that I can run **DFS** on every node.
For every node, I want to be able to store the **prerequisites** of every node in a bitset (with `0` being not prerequisites and vice versa).
To do this, I defined a `vector<bitset<101>>` (since the problem statement defines there to be a maximum of `100` different nodes). 

Then, we run **DFS** on every node and use the `101`th bit to help determine *if we have seen this node or not* (`0` being *unseen*, and `1` being *seen*),
since we only need *100 bits* for *100 different nodes*.

- if we **have** seen the node before, we can simply **or** the bitset of the node with its *parent node* (so the parent node will *share* the *same prerequisites*)
- if we **have not** seen the node before, we just run **DFS** on the children of the node, and eventually **or** the *bitset of the children node* with the *parent's bitset*
:::

Then, after running **DFS** on every node, for every query, we should be able to index into the `vector<bitset<101>>` to be able to return if `query[0]` is a *prerequisite* of `query[1]`.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    constexpr static auto init = bitset<101> (1) << 100;
    bitset<101>& dfs (int index, vector<vector<int>> &adjacencyMatrix, vector<bitset<101>> &isPrerequisite) {
        auto& ans = isPrerequisite[index];
        if (ans != init) {
            return ans;
        }
        ans.reset();
        for (auto &node : adjacencyMatrix[index]) {
            ans.set(node);
            ans |= dfs(node, adjacencyMatrix, isPrerequisite);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    vector<bool> checkIfPrerequisite(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<vector<int>> adjacencyMatrix (numCourses);
        vector<bitset<101>> isPrerequisite (numCourses, init);

        for (auto &edges : prerequisites) {
            adjacencyMatrix[edges[0]].push_back(edges[1]);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            dfs(i, adjacencyMatrix, isPrerequisite);
        }

        vector<bool> ans;
        for (auto &query : queries) {
            ans.push_back(isPrerequisite[query[0]][query[1]]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
