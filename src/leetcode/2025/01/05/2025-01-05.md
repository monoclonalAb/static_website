The trick to this question also lies within the **prefix sum**.

In my algorithm, instead of *brute-forcing* and *incrementing every letter* in `s` between `start` and `end` for each `shift` operation,
you create another array, `ps`, 
such that you keep track of each `shift` operation by **only** incrementing/decrementing the `start` and `end` index in `ps`. 

The *thought-process* is that since we are *iterating* through the array regardless,
it would be most efficient to simulatenously **calculate and shift** `s[i]`.
We can do this using a global `counter` variable to keep track of each character's `shift` amount when we iterate past them.

This is because, for example, if we want to *increment all the characters* between index `5` and `10`,
we can simply increment `counter` at index `5` and decrement `counter` at index `11` 
(so that `s[i]+counter` gets incremented for indexes `5` to `10`). 
We can do this for each `shift` operation and track this using the `ps` array.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    string shiftingLetters(string s, vector<vector<int>>& shifts) {
        vector<int> ps (s.size()+1, 0);
        for (vector<int> &shift : shifts) {
            ps[shift[0]] += (shift[2] == 1 ? 1 : -1);
            ps[shift[1]+1] += (shift[2] == 1 ? -1 : 1);
        }
        
        int counter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            counter += ps[i];
            s[i] = (((s[i]-'a')+counter)%26 + 26)%26 + 'a';
        }
        return s;
    }
};
```
