This question immediately feels like a **breadth-first search question**;
I do not believe there are any *special tricks* per se,
as it seems like quite a formulaic question.

In my algorithm, we initialize an `m x n` grid, `costGrid`, to *store the costs at each square we have visited*
and a queue, `currSquares`, to *keep track of all the squares we need to traverse through at each `cost` level*.
The queue starts off with only one square (the one at `0, 0`).

### While Loop:
Then, while `currSquares` is *not empty*, we pop the front element and check if we have visited it or not.

- if we have, then we continue to the *next element*
- if we have not, then we *traverse through the directed path*, updating `costGrid` at each square and stopping only if we **go out of bounds** or **traverse to a square we have visited before**. At every square, we also check for any neighbouring squares that have **not been visited** and is **not being directly pointed to** by the original square and append it to a seperate queue, `nextSquares`. 
:::

Note, that for *every new Square that we visit*, we check if it is the **bottom-right square** (the square at index position `[m-1][n-1]`). 
If it is, then we `return` the `cost` value immediately.

Once `currSquares` is empty
(there is another `if` statement inside the `while` loop to catch this, meaning the initial `while` loop is still running),
then we know we have **visited every square possible at this specific `cost` level**.
We then swap the queues `currSquares` and `nextSquares` around and repeat the steps from the start of the `while` loop.

Note, this should be enough to solve the question, however, I still added a `return costGrid[m-1][n-1]` at the end as the non-`void` function requires a `return` value in all control paths
and *just in case I somehow do not manage to visit all squares*.
