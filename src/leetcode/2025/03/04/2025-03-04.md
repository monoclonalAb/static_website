I saw 2 solutions.

The first one was to repeatedly subtract the largest power of `3` from `n`, and then:

:::sidebar
- if `n == 0`, then we know that `n` was made up of **only** powers of `3`
- if `n != 0`, then we know that `n` was **not** made up only of powers of `3`
:::

## Code<span>:</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkPowersOfThree(int n) {
        for (int i = ceil(log(n)/log(3)); i >= 0; --i) {
            if (n >= pow(3, i)) {
                n -= pow(3, i);
            }
        }
        if (n == 0) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

The other solution was to just repeatedly divide `n` by `3`; 
if `n` is made up of only powers of `3`, then the remainder of `n/3` should always be either `0` or `1`.

Therefore, to see if `n` is made up of only powers of `3`, 
we can just check `n % 3` and repeatedly floor divide `n` until we get `n%3 == 2`, where we return `false`, or until `n == 0`, where we return `true`.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkPowersOfThree(int n) {
        while (n > 0) {
            int remainder = n%3;
            if (remainder == 2) {
                return false;
            }
            n /= 3;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
