You can calculate the number of coloured cells in `n` cells instantly by realising that:

:::sidebar
- *ignoring the center row*, both halves always has `(n-1)^2` coloured cells
- the center row always has `2n-1` coloured cells
:::

Therefore, you can simply just return `2 * (n-1)^2 + (2n - 1)`.

## Code<span>:</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    long long coloredCells(int n) {
        return 2 * ((long long) (n-1) * (n-1)) + (n * 2 - 1);   
    }
};
```

### Complexity<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- Time: `O(1)`
- Space: `O(1)`
:::


### Time Taken<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- erm, I forgot to stop the timer, but it was like 3 minutes or something...
