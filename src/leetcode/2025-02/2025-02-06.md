I like to **hash** out a plan to **map** out my solution for **upcoming leetcode questions**. Yes, it is a **hash-map** problem.

Problem itself is quite *straightforward* once you see the vision:

::: sidebar
- we can iterate through *all possible pairs* to find **all** the possible products and store the *frequency* of each one in a hash-map 
- then, we can iterate through **all** the `[key, value]` pairs of the `unordered_map`. If we let the *frequency* of a product be denoted by `n`, then the number of *valid tuples* that can be formed is just `(n)*(n-1)*4`.
    - this can be easily derived after realising that there are *n* choices for the pair `[a, b]`, meaning there will remain *n-1* choices for the pair `[c, d]`. Then, since we can *rearrange* the order of `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` (e.g. `a * b` is the same as `b * a`), we get `n * (n-1) * 2 * 2 = n * (n-1) * 4` as expected.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int tupleSameProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = i+1; j < nums.size(); ++j) {
                ++mp[nums[i] * nums[j]];
            }
        }

        for (auto &multiple : mp) {
            ans += (multiple.second * (multiple.second-1)) * 4;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
