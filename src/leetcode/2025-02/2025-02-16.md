The constraints are practically asking for **brute-force**.
You **do not** need to find any special tricks; there is no way you `TLE`.

Since, we are trying to find the **lexicographically largest** answer, realise that for each index, if we start checking every value from `n` to `1`,
the first answer we return will *naturally* be the **lexicographically largest** answer.

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
private:
    bool recursion (int index, int n, vector<int>& current, vector<int>& used) {
        if (index == current.size()) {
            return true;
        }
        if (current[index] != 0) {
            return recursion(index+1, n, current, used);
        }
        for (int i = n; i >= 1; --i) {
            if (used[i] == 1) continue;

            current[index] = i;
            used[i] = 1;

            if (i == 1) {
                if (recursion(index+1, n, current, used)) {
                    return true;
                }
            } else if (index+i < 2*n-1 && current[index+i] == 0) {
                current[index+i] = i;

- brother, look at the restraints before you attempt the question; a lot of the times the questions do not have a **special trick** or `O(n)` solution

### Time taken<span>:</span>

:::sidebar
- too long... (60+ minutes)
    - made the mistake of investing too much time into an `O(n)` solution that does not work
