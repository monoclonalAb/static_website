This question has to be misclassified.

I sorted `nums` and iterated through all the elements in `nums` until I found one that was missing, and returned it.

## Code<span>:</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    string findDifferentBinaryString(vector<string>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        string temp(nums.size(), '0');
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (temp != nums[i]) {
                return temp;
            }
            int index = nums.size()-1;
            while(temp[index] == '1') {
                temp[index--] = '0';
            }
            temp[index] = '1';
        }
        return temp;
    }
};
```

However, you can just use **[Cantor's Diagonal Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor's_diagonal_argument)**.

Just iterate through all `n` elements, and generate a string of length `n`, `ans`, by making the `i`th bit in `ans` the opposite of the `i`th bit in `nums[i]` for `0 <= i < n`.
Then, you know that `ans` is **unique**, since there is at least `1` bit that is different in `ans` to every element in `nums`.

## Code<span>:</span>

``` {.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    string findDifferentBinaryString(vector<string>& nums) {
        string ans = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            ans += (nums[i][i] == '0') ? "1" : "0";
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

    - slightly embarrassing honestly; I forgot how to do string manipulation...
