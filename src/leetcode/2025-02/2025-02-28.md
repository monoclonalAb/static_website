Alas, I have uploaded the write-up for this question.

After misreading this question a billion times, I realised you can break this question down into several portions.
It asks you to *find the shortest string that has both* `str1` *and* `str2` *as* **subsequences**. 
To accomplish this, it is much easier to instead:

::: sidebar
- find the *largest* ***common*** *subsequence between* `str1` *and* `str2`
- add in the missing letters from `str1` and `str2` to the *largest* **common** *subsequence*
:::

To find the **largest** common subsequence, we can just use **dynamic programming** to first find the length of the **largest** common subsequence.

First, we can initialise the 2D matrix `dp` with dimensions `str1.size() + 1` and `str2.size() + 2` 
(we make it `+1` height and width so the DP algorithm does not go *out of bounds*), 
where `dp[i1][i2]` contains the length of the **largest** common subsequence for `str1[0:i1]` and `str2[0:i2]`.
Then, when we iterate through `str1` and `str2`, we check for:

::: sidebar
- `str1[i1] == str2[i2]`, we can let `dp[i1+1][j1+1] = dp[i1][j1] + 1` (as we are adding 1 letter to the *previous* **largest** common subsequence) 
- `str1[i1] != str2[i2]`, we can let `dp[i1+1][j1+1] = max(dp[i1+1][j1], dp[i1, j1+1])` (as we the *previous* **largest** common subsequence is not changing)
:::

Then, we know `dp[str1.size()][str2.size()]` contains the length of the **largest** common subsequence.

We can then use **backtracking** to find out what the letters present in the **largest** common subsequence is.
Note, we do not directly deal with storing *strings* inside the `dp` matrix, 
as that would exacerbate the time taken for each operation in the `O(n^2)` DP algorithm,
and would definitely exceed the **memory limit** for longer strings.

To do this, we can simply use a **recursive** function that adds a letter whenever `str1[i1] == str2[i2]` and `dp[i1+1][i2+1] == dp[i1][i2] + 1`
as satisfying both these equalities signifies that we added the letter `str1[i1]` to the *previous* **largest** common subsequence
to form the *current* **largest** common subsequence, `subseq`.

Finally, letting `ans` be the string we return, 
we can do an iteration through `subseq`, adding letters from `str1` and `str2` only when they do not equal `subseq[i]`, `0 <= i < subseq.size()`.
Then, after the iteration, we can add the remaining letters from `str1` and `str2` to `ans`, 
to get an example of the *shortest string that has both* `str1` *and* `str2` *as* **subsequences**.

            }
        }

        string subseq = shortestCommonSubsequence(str1.size()-1, str2.size()-1, str1, str2, dp);
        int i1 = 0;
        int i2 = 0;
        string ans = "";
