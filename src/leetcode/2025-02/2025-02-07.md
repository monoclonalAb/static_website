I am not going to lie, this question *spoke* to me and told me to use some **hashmaps**; **two** to be specific.

The `unordered_maps` that I had to initalise were `ball` and `colour_count`:

::: sidebar
- `ball` is used to keep track of what each **ball's colour** is
- `colour_count` is used to keep track of the **number** of balls *in each colour*.
:::

Then, I just iterated through the `queries`, maintaining a `temp` variable to keep track of the number of unique colours present:

::: sidebar
- if define each pair in `queries` to be `[ball_number, colour_number]`, then if `ball[ball_number]` has a colour, then we need to subtract 1 from `colour_count[ball[ball_number]]` as we are painting over the original colour
    - we also need to account for that fact that if `colour_count[ball[ball_number]] == 0` after subtraction, then we can `erase` `colour_count[ball[ball_number]]` and subtract 1 from `temp` as there is *1 less colour* present
- then, we just make `ball[ball_number] = colour_number`, increment `colour_count[colour_number]` and *add 1* to `temp` if `colour_count[colour_number]` did **not** exist previously.
