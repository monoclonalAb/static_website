Where did all my beloved **string manipulation** questions go?! Slight disaster, but it is a-ok, since today's question is a **priority_queue** question.

Starting off, we know we can ignore all the values **greater** than `k` as they already satisfy the pre-requisite.
This means we can start off by *pre-computing* all the values that are **smaller** than `k` as they are the only **relevant** values needed to solve this question.

Consequently, once we do pre-compute all the *relevant values*, the only way to possibly count the **minimum** number of the *previously described operation* is if we 
just... repeat the operation... over and over again... yeah, not the *fanciest* solution ever. However, the most efficient data-structure for this question is a `priority_queue`
(or a `min heap`) as at every step, we have to retrieve the **2 smallest values** and re-insert the **new calculated value** back into the `list` while maintaining the *same order*
(a task perfect for a `priority_queue`).

Therefore, you just repeat the operation, until the `priority_queue` is empty or has size equal to `1` (whilst keeping a counter `ans` of all the operations that have been initialized)

- if the `priority_queue` is **empty**, then return `ans`
- else if the `priority_queue` has size equal to `1`, then return `ans + 1` (still `1` more operation needed before all `nums[i] > k` for `0 <= i < nums.size()`)

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> valid;
        for (int &n : nums) {
            if (n < k) {
                valid.push(n);
            }
        }
        if (valid.size() == 0) return 0;

        int ans = 0;
        while (valid.size() > 1) {
            ++ans;
            int min1 = valid.top();
            valid.pop();
            int min2 = valid.top();
            valid.pop();

            int new_value = min1 + min2;
            if (new_value >= k) continue;
            new_value += min1;
            if (new_value >= k) continue;
            else {
                valid.push(new_value);
            }
        }

        return valid.size() == 1 ? ans + 1 : ans;
    }

- 16 minutes and 21.04 seconds on Google Stopwatch
- spent most time trying to:
    - decipher the `priority_queue` syntax
    - forgetting that `int` has range `-2 * 10^31 <= int <= 2 * 10^31 - 1`, meaning `2 * 999,999,999 + 999,999,999 = 2,999,999,998 > 2 * 10^31 - 1`
