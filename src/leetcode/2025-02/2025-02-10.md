There have been quite the number of <difficulty class="Easy">Easy</difficulty> questions this month.

Since we only delete the *first* digit and the **closest non-digit** character to its *left*,
you could just iterate through `s` in **reverse** and just *not* append the letters after a digit character to `ans`.
(of course, you still have to *flip the string*)

## Code<span>:</span>

```{.cpp}
class Solution {
public:
    string clearDigits(string s) {
        string ans = "";
        int counter = 0;
        for (int i = s.size()-1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (s[i]-'0' >= 0 && s[i]-'0' <= 9) {
                ++counter;
            } else if (counter > 0) {
                --counter;
            } else {
                ans += s[i];
            }
        }
        reverse(ans.begin(), ans.end());
        return
    }
};
```
